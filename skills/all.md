# Brainstorm options

Use this workflow when a user needs possible approaches to a decision, problem, or opportunity but is not ready to commit. The goal is not a long list of ideas; it is to surface genuinely different paths, make their tradeoffs clear, and leave the user with a small number of credible choices.

## 1. Gather relevant context

Start with the information the user supplied. If they reference documents, discussion threads, prior decisions, research, or other accessible sources, review them first.

When accessing internal records or communications, do so only for a legitimate purpose and with clear authorization. Retrieve only the minimum sources and details needed to frame the decision. Respect applicable consent, confidentiality, and privacy expectations, especially when records concern identifiable people. Do not use unrelated sensitive personal information—such as health, financial, family, identity, performance, or private-message details—to generate options unless it is necessary, authorized, and appropriate to the decision.

Keep both the research process and the output within the user’s appropriate access boundary. Do not reveal private source content, identify people unnecessarily, or include details that recipients are not entitled to receive. Summarize relevant evidence at the lowest level of detail that still supports the decision.

If the question is not self-contained, retrieve a small number of high-value sources, such as:

- Earlier decisions and their rationale
- Existing constraints, commitments, budgets, or deadlines
- Stakeholder concerns and ownership boundaries
- Evidence about what has already been tried

Do not search broadly by default. Use targeted retrieval only when it could materially change the options. If important information is unavailable, state the assumption or ask a focused question rather than inventing context.

## 2. Frame the decision before ideating

Write a short framing, usually two to four sentences, that states:

- What decision the user is actually making
- The important constraints and non-negotiables
- What a good outcome looks like and how options should be judged

The user’s wording may describe a symptom or requested solution rather than the real decision. For example, “Should we add a feature?” may really mean “How should we reduce a recurring user problem within a limited budget?”

Ask the user to confirm or correct the framing before generating a substantial option set. Skip the pause only when the framing is obvious, low-stakes, or the user explicitly requests an immediate first pass. Incorrect framing produces polished but irrelevant options.

## 3. Generate a distinct set of options

Generate five to seven options unless the decision naturally has fewer meaningful paths. Each option must be a fundamentally different approach, not a different intensity level of the same approach. Merge near-duplicates.

Include, where relevant:

- The obvious or conventional option
- A lower-effort or incremental option
- A more ambitious option
- An option that changes the process, incentives, scope, or problem framing
- At least one surprising option, such as delaying, partnering, removing scope, or doing nothing

Do not be contrarian merely to appear creative. “Do nothing” is useful only when observation, timing, or avoided distraction has real value.

Give every option a short, memorable label that communicates its core approach. For each option, provide:

- **What:** One or two sentences explaining the approach.
- **Strengths:** One or two concrete advantages.
- **Weaknesses:** One or two concrete disadvantages or failure risks.
- **Effort:** Low, Medium, or High.

Use specific tradeoffs. Do not soften serious drawbacks, and do not make a preferred option look better by describing alternatives unfairly.

## 4. Evaluate and recommend

Choose evaluation criteria that fit the decision. Common criteria include likely impact, effort, cost, risk, speed, reversibility, strategic fit, and stakeholder burden. Add domain-specific criteria when they matter more than the defaults.

Then:

1. Identify options with dealbreaker weaknesses under the stated constraints. Keep them visible if they are instructive, but say clearly why they are not recommended.
2. Rank the strongest two or three options.
3. For each recommendation, explain in one sentence why it fits this user’s situation, constraints, and goals—not why it is generally attractive.
4. Name the key assumption most likely to change the ranking, if one exists.

Do not force a single winner unless the user explicitly requests one. Preserve meaningful choice.

## 5. Stop for a decision

After presenting recommendations, wait for the user. They may choose an option, request detail, reject the framing, ask for new options, or combine approaches.

If the user proposes a hybrid, test whether its components are compatible and whether combining them resolves a real tradeoff rather than merely adding complexity. Do not begin implementation merely because an option appears promising.

## 6. Hand off with the right level of rigor

Once the user selects a path, choose the next activity based on consequence and reversibility:

- **High-consequence or difficult-to-reverse choices:** Run a structured challenge or pre-mortem before commitment. Use this for major strategic bets, public commitments, long-term contracts, major staffing choices, or decisions with broad organizational effects.
- **Reversible choices:** Create a right-sized decision record: define the choice, owner, rationale, assumptions, and review point.
- **Build-oriented choices:** After the decision is recorded, move into planning and execution: requirements, milestones, implementation tasks, and validation.

A useful sequence is: brainstorm options, pressure-test consequential choices, make the decision, then plan or build. Avoid skipping the pressure test when the cost of being wrong is high.

## Quality checks

Before sending the response, verify that:

- The framing reflects the actual decision rather than only the initial wording.
- The options are genuinely distinct and not intensity variations of one idea.
- The set includes the obvious path and, where useful, a credible unconventional path.
- Weaknesses are candid, concrete, and proportionate.
- Effort labels are plausible.
- Recommendations follow the user’s stated criteria rather than the assistant’s default preferences.
- Any private or personal context was necessary, authorized, minimized, handled consistently with consent and privacy expectations, and kept within the appropriate output-access boundary.

name: pressure-test
description: Find the weak points in a leading strategic idea before committing to it. Steelman the case, test its load-bearing assumptions through sequential challenge, and finish with a clear verdict, handoff, and concrete next action.
---

# Pressure-test an idea

Use this workflow when a decision-maker is leaning toward a strategic direction and needs an honest challenge before committing. It tests a leading option; it does not generate a broad option set or create an implementation plan.

## Where this fits

Use this sequence:

1. Generate or identify meaningful alternatives.
2. Pressure-test the leading option.
3. Make and document the decision with rigor proportional to its consequences.
4. Plan, build, or execute the chosen approach.

**Readiness gates**

- If meaningful alternatives have not been considered, pause and generate them first. Testing one idea too early can become an exercise in defending it.
- If this idea was pressure-tested recently and no material evidence, assumptions, or conditions have changed, do not repeat the process. Use the existing findings in the decision process.
- If the idea is not stated clearly enough to test, first turn it into a specific claim.

## Rules of engagement

- Be direct. Confidence is not evidence.
- Attack the strongest reasonable version of the idea, not a weak caricature.
- Ask one forcing question at a time. Wait for the response, assess it, and challenge vague, unsupported, or evasive answers before continuing.
- Use evidence where available: research, operating metrics, prior experiments, customer feedback, documented decisions, and relevant stakeholder input. Separate facts, inferences, and forecasts.
- If consulting private records or communications, use them only for a legitimate, authorized purpose. Use the minimum relevant sources, avoid unrelated personal details, and keep findings within the appropriate access boundary.
- Identify dissent by relevant role, such as finance owner, delivery lead, customer representative, domain expert, or skeptical peer. Do not invent a person's view.
- Skip a section only if it is genuinely irrelevant, and state why.

## 1. Steelman the claim

Restate the idea in its strongest form. Remove unnecessary hedging while preserving the decision-maker's intent. Include the action, expected result, mechanism, timeframe, and conditions that make the claim plausible.

**Template**

> We should [take action] because [mechanism] will produce [outcome] for [group] within [timeframe], provided that [key condition] holds.

If the original framing is already the strongest version, say so and continue. If the stronger restatement changes the intended claim, get confirmation before testing it.

## 2. Identify load-bearing assumptions

List three to five assumptions that must hold for the claim to work. Rank them by the damage caused if they are wrong. Make each assumption observable where possible.

| Rank | Assumption | Type: fact, estimate, or belief | Current support | Damage if wrong | Smallest useful test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [State the assumption] | [Choose one] | [Summarize evidence] | [Low, medium, or high] | [Name a test or disproof method] |

Replace broad claims such as “customers will value this” with observable conditions, for example a defined audience, behavior, threshold, or willingness-to-pay signal.

## 3. Run forcing questions sequentially

Ask five to eight questions in total, one at a time. Start with the highest-risk assumption. Adapt later questions to the answer received. Do not present the full list as a questionnaire, because that permits selective answering.

Choose from these categories as relevant:

- **Evidence:** What is the strongest evidence for this? What is the strongest evidence against it?
- **Falsifiability:** What would need to happen in the next 30 or 90 days to show this is wrong?
- **Counterfactual:** What similar attempt failed, and why is this case materially different?
- **Opportunity cost:** What valuable work will not happen if resources go here?
- **Second-order effects:** If this succeeds, what does the situation look like in 12 months? What could success itself break or constrain?
- **Stakeholder dissent:** Which role would object most strongly? What would that role say? Has that objection been heard directly?
- **Reversibility:** If this is wrong, what does unwinding require in time, money, commitments, trust, or organizational disruption?
- **Null option:** What happens if no action is taken for the next three months?

Push for specifics. “I think it will work” is not evidence. Ask for observed behavior, data, a comparison, a commitment, or a testable forecast.

## 4. Run a pre-mortem

Assume the initiative failed after a realistic period, usually 6 to 12 months. Identify the three most likely failure modes, ordered by likelihood or impact. Include a wrong premise, execution failure, and external condition when relevant.

| Failure mode | Why it could happen | Earliest warning sign | Monitoring action and owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Describe the failure] | [Name the mechanism] | [Name an observable signal] | [Name the check and accountable role] |

A warning sign must appear early enough for the team to change course.

## 5. Surface credible dissent

Identify two or three relevant roles that could reasonably disagree. State each role's strongest likely objection. If the decision-maker has not sought that perspective, mark it as an evidence gap. Silence is not agreement.

Dissent is not automatically a veto. Its purpose is to expose constraints, incentives, dependencies, and risks that supporters may miss.

| Relevant role | Strongest likely objection | Heard directly? | Required follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Role] | [Objection] | [Yes, no, or unknown] | [Action to take] |

## 6. Define what would change the decision

Require one sentence naming the evidence that would reverse or materially alter the position.

**Template**

> I would change my mind if [specific observable evidence] occurs by [date or decision point].

If this cannot be stated, the claim is not falsifiable. Mark the pressure-test as incomplete or failed rather than approving it.

## 7. Give a verdict and handoff

Choose one verdict and state the next step explicitly.

- **GREEN: Proceed to decision.** Core assumptions have credible support, relevant dissent has been addressed, reversal costs are understood, and warning signs have an owner or review mechanism. Next: document and make the decision. For hard-to-reverse or organization-defining decisions, schedule a review point.
- **AMBER: Test first.** The idea may be sound, but one or two high-impact assumptions or objections remain under-investigated. Name the gap and the cheapest credible way to close it, such as a small interview set, expert review, prototype, or short data-collection period. Next: run the test, then decide with the result recorded.
- **RED: Stop, redesign, or reopen options.** A core assumption is weak, downside is unacceptable, or no meaningful falsification criterion can be named. Next: generate alternatives, redesign the idea, or explicitly defer it until a defined trigger occurs. Do not treat RED as approval with caveats.

End with exactly one concrete next action. It must contain a verb, an owner, and a deadline when useful.

**Example:** `Research owner: interview five target users this week and compare the findings with the adoption assumption.`

## Final audit

Before closing, verify that the output contains:

- a confirmed steelman;
- three to five ranked load-bearing assumptions;
- five to eight forcing questions explored sequentially;
- a pre-mortem with early warning signs and monitoring ownership;
- credible dissenting roles and their objections;
- a clear mind-change criterion;
- a GREEN, AMBER, or RED verdict with a next workflow step; and
- one concrete next action.

Common failures include skipping alternatives, asking all questions at once, confusing confidence with evidence, treating unconsulted stakeholders as aligned, repeating a recent test without new facts, and issuing a positive verdict without falsifiable criteria or monitoring.

description: Match decision-making rigor to stakes and reversibility, make clear commitments when ready, and preserve authorized records and reviews without inventing the user’s views or exposing sensitive information.
---

# Make a decision

Use this workflow to make decisions with the right amount of rigor. The objective is not maximum analysis. It is to make a clear call when ready, preserve the reasoning for meaningful choices, and improve future judgment through review.

## Core rules

1. **Match rigor to stakes and reversibility.** Most decisions should take minutes, not days.
2. **The user owns their position.** Never state, record, or imply that the user believes, prefers, or decided something they did not actually say.
3. **Separate advice from attribution.** Assistant recommendations belong in conversation and must be labeled as assistant analysis. Add them to a record only if the user asks.
4. **Do not confuse a task with a decision.** If no meaningful alternative exists, this is execution. Plan or start the task instead.
5. **Record only with permission.** “Should we do X?” requests analysis, not a record. Create or update a record only when the user asks to log, track, open, or commit it, or explicitly agrees to doing so.
6. **Respect access boundaries.** Before accessing shared communications, personnel information, customer information, or a shared decision register, confirm a legitimate purpose and clear authorization. Use only the minimum relevant sources and omit unrelated sensitive details.

If a decision register has a shared audience, confirm that the audience is appropriate before writing. For health, relationships, compensation, confidential personnel matters, or similarly sensitive topics, offer a private record or keep the discussion in chat.

## 1. Choose the mode

Determine whether the work concerns a new or existing decision.

- **New:** No matching record exists, or the user wants a fresh decision.
- **Resume:** An open decision exists and the user wants to continue thinking.
- **Commit:** An open decision exists and the user is ready to make the call.
- **Review:** A resolved decision has reached its review date and still needs an outcome assessment.

If the user explicitly names the mode, follow that instruction. Otherwise, if authorized, search the chosen register for overlapping decisions before creating a duplicate. For resume, append new information rather than rewriting history. For review, use the original prediction and reasoning as the baseline.

## 2. Frame the decision

Write the question in a decidable form. Establish:

- What choice is being made?
- Who has final decision authority?
- What are the realistic options, including doing nothing?
- What deadline, event, or trigger requires a decision?
- What result is desired?
- What happens if no action is taken?

If the question is broad and options do not yet exist, generate options before evaluating them. If there is only one viable path, say so directly: “This appears to be a task rather than a decision. The next step is to plan or execute it.”

## 3. Classify scope

Ask one clarifying question at a time when classification is unclear. Use this test: **What would it cost to unwind this?** Include money, time, trust, operational disruption, opportunity cost, and reputation.

| Bucket | Meaning | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial | Low stakes; reversible within hours | Decide now; do not log by default |
| Reversible | Moderate stakes; changeable within days or weeks | Compare a few options; use a light record if useful |
| Hard to reverse | Material cost, disruption, or loss if undone | Full analysis, challenge gate, and stakeholder check |
| Direction-setting | Shapes strategy, culture, finances, or operating model for an extended period | Full analysis, explicit dissent, and prerequisite conversations |

If a supposedly trivial decision has an unclear or non-obvious unwind cost, treat it as larger until clarified.

## 4. Apply the right rigor

### Trivial

Pick a reasonable default, state a one-sentence rationale, and move on. If the user is stalling, name the cost of delay: continued attention may cost more than an imperfect choice.

### Reversible

1. List two or three realistic options.
2. For each, state one major strength, one major weakness, and a rough effort or cost estimate.
3. Recommend an option and name the decisive reason.
4. If uncertainty is material, choose the smallest reversible test that could change the call.

### Hard to reverse: challenge gate

Before commitment, pressure-test the leading option. A valid pressure test examines assumptions, disconfirming evidence, likely failure modes, the strongest alternative, and major stakeholder objections.

If no relevant pressure test has occurred in the current work context, stop the commitment flow and say:

> This is hard to reverse. Pressure-test the leading option before committing. To proceed without that step, explicitly state why the gate is being skipped.

Do not proceed merely because the user is in a hurry. Continue only after the pressure test is complete or the user explicitly overrides it with a reason. If the test identifies a serious unresolved failure, return to option generation, redesign the option, gather a decision-changing fact, or run a bounded test.

After the gate is satisfied:

1. Define options and decision criteria.
2. Run a pre-mortem: “It is later and this failed. What most likely caused it?”
3. Check stakeholders: who has relevant expertise, bears consequences, or may reveal a constraint?
4. Give a recommendation labeled as assistant analysis unless the user adopts it in their own words.

### Direction-setting

Use the hard-to-reverse process plus two readiness gates:

1. Name the specific accountable leader, partner, advisor, or stakeholder conversation required before commitment.
2. Ask who disagrees and capture their strongest case fairly.

The decision is not ready until the required conversation has happened, unless the user explicitly accepts and records a reason for proceeding without it. If it is being rushed, state which consultation, evidence, or dissent is being skipped and why that matters.

## 5. Analyze without manufacturing certainty

For each serious option, capture what it enables, what it costs or prevents, its strongest supporting evidence, its strongest objection, its key assumptions, and its reversal cost. Choose criteria before comparing options. Separate non-negotiable requirements from preferences. Use scoring only when it clarifies tradeoffs rather than disguising judgment.

Keep these categories distinct:

- **User’s stated view:** Only positions the user actually expressed.
- **Assistant analysis:** Recommendation and reasoning supplied by the assistant.
- **Open question:** Uncertainty not yet resolved.

If the user has not expressed a position, record “No position stated yet” or leave that field blank. Never invent a lean, confidence level, rationale, response to dissent, or final choice.

## 6. Commit and record

Before finalizing, confirm the decision, chosen option, reason it is preferred now, conditions that would change it, next action owner and date, observable prediction, and the user’s confidence in that prediction.

For meaningful decisions, make the prediction testable:

> By [date or trigger], [observable outcome] will happen or not happen.  
> Confidence: [percentage].

Use the user’s chosen register, document system, or private file. Recommended fields are status, domain, stakes, reversibility, decision date, review date, confidence, and outcome. Suggested review defaults are one month for reversible choices, three months for hard-to-reverse choices, and six months for direction-setting choices. Add a reminder for high-stakes reviews using the user’s chosen calendar or task system.

```markdown
## Context
Why this decision exists and why it matters now.

## Options considered
- **Option A:** What it is and its central tradeoff.
- **Option B:** What it is and its central tradeoff.
- **Option C:** What it is and its central tradeoff.

## Thinking log
### [Date]
- New inputs, conversations, data, or events
- How the thinking changed
- User’s stated position today: open / leaning / decided

## Dissent
Who pushed back, their strongest argument, and how it was handled.

## My choice and why
The user’s own reasoning, only when stated by the user.

## What would change my mind
Assumptions or evidence that would justify reversing the choice.

## Prediction
By [date], [observable outcome] will happen or not happen.
Confidence: [X%]

## Worries
The most credible downside or failure mode.

## Retrospective
To be completed at review.
```

For a new open decision, record context, options, and new inputs; leave commitment sections blank. When resuming, append a dated thinking-log entry rather than overwriting prior reasoning.

## 7. Review the outcome

At the review point, assess:

1. **What happened?** Use concrete actuals, not impressions.
2. **Was the prediction accurate?** Compare events with the recorded prediction and confidence.
3. **Was the process sound?** Judge the information, assumptions, alternatives, and reasoning available at the time.
4. **What is the reusable lesson?** State a principle for future decisions.

Mark the outcome as correct, incorrect, mixed, too early, or not applicable. Do not treat a bad outcome as proof of a bad process, or a good outcome as proof of a sound process.

## Completion message

When a decision is made, summarize it clearly:

```markdown
Decision: [one-line call]
Scope: [bucket]
Rationale: [two or three honest sentences]
Next action: [owner] will [action] by [date]
Review: [date or trigger]
Record: [location, if one exists]
```

Use direct language. Challenge weak reasoning with evidence, but do not turn rigor into endless deliberation. Once the appropriate readiness gates are met, name the decision and move forward.

name: solve-a-problem
description: Take a non-trivial product, technical, process, or automation problem from diagnosis through options, implementation, verification, and handoff. The workflow supports analysis-only work when requested.
---

# Solve a problem

Use this workflow for a non-trivial build, integration, automation, process, or operational problem whose solution is not already obvious. Do not use it for a small fix or a routine task with a known implementation.

By default, work from understanding through implementation. If the user requests analysis only, stop after the recommendation and wait for a decision.

## 1. Understand the problem

Start with the underlying problem, not the user's first proposed solution. If they ask to “build X,” work backward:

- Who experiences the problem, and in what role or situation?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What happens today?
- What workarounds exist?
- How frequent, costly, urgent, or blocking is it?
- What outcome would make the problem meaningfully better?

Write a concise problem statement and descriptive requirements. Describe the desired outcome, constraints, and success conditions rather than assuming a particular implementation.

If the proposed solution appears mismatched to the problem, say so directly. Ask only for information that cannot be found in authorized, relevant context such as project documentation, code, or operational records.

When using records or communications about people, confirm a legitimate purpose and clear authorization. Use the minimum relevant sources and details, omit unrelated sensitive information, and keep findings within the appropriate access boundary.

## 2. Assess whether to solve it now

Assess severity, frequency, affected users, opportunity cost, available alternatives, and maintenance burden. Include **do nothing**, **deprioritize**, or **improve the workaround** as real options when the issue is rare, low-cost, or adequately handled.

Distinguish between decisions that are easy to reverse and commitments that are expensive to undo:

- **Reversible decisions:** small choices with low switching cost. Use reasonable judgment, choose, and move forward.
- **Hard-to-reverse decisions:** public interfaces, persistent data changes, migrations, long-lived settings, security boundaries, external contracts, or vendor commitments. Pause and obtain an explicit decision before implementing. Record the decision and rationale when appropriate.

If priority or direction is unclear, present the tradeoff and ask the responsible decision-maker to choose before investing substantially in design or implementation.

## 3. Research the current context

Read the relevant project instructions, architecture notes, repository guidance, service documentation, existing code, tests, operational procedures, and prior attempts. Find established patterns and reusable components before inventing new ones.

Understand compatibility requirements, deployment practices, access controls, supported environments, ownership boundaries, observability, and operational constraints. Follow the system’s conventions unless there is a clear reason to change them.

Research only sources needed for the problem. Do not copy personal details, credentials, internal identifiers, or unrelated operational information into proposals, plans, logs, or outputs.

## 4. Define evaluation criteria

Define explicit, lightweight criteria before generating solutions. For example:

- Must preserve existing authentication, authorization, and data behavior.
- Must be feasible within the available time and maintenance capacity.
- Should avoid new dependencies, long-lived configuration, or permanent interfaces.
- Must have a clear verification method.
- Must be removable or reversible if it fails.
- Must meet relevant privacy, security, reliability, and performance requirements.

These criteria guide both option generation and selection. Without them, the first plausible idea can win by accident.

## 5. Generate varied approaches

Generate genuinely different approaches, not minor variations of one design. Consider:

1. Do nothing, defer, or improve the current workaround.
2. A non-code change, such as clearer instructions, a process adjustment, a template, training, or an existing platform capability.
3. A small targeted technical change.
4. A larger integrated solution.
5. Build, buy, or integrate with an existing service.

For an ambiguous problem, generate a wider set of candidates before narrowing. Keep each option short: what it is, what it solves, major costs, and key risks.

### Design principles for technical options

- Prefer one understandable code path over special cases whose behavior changes with runtime conditions.
- Validate inputs and invariants strictly. Fail clearly for invalid states rather than silently converting programming errors into plausible but incorrect results.
- Prefer established conventions over new abstractions, and new abstractions over long-lived configuration.
- Treat new fields, settings, integrations, and public interfaces as maintenance commitments.
- Prefer well-bounded changes that can be removed cleanly.
- Use familiar, proven technology and existing infrastructure where possible.
- Design for deterministic, isolated testing.
- Prioritize correctness over performance unless performance is a stated requirement.
- Put changes in the appropriate design boundary; avoid quick fixes that create hidden future work.

## 6. Evaluate and recommend

Compare viable options against the criteria from Step 4. Present a concise proposal containing:

- The problem statement.
- Evaluation criteria.
- Viable options and tradeoffs.
- One clear recommendation and why it is preferred.
- Important risks, irreversible consequences, dependencies, and open decisions.

Keep proposals direct and short: usually one or two paragraphs per option. Store durable proposals in the user’s chosen shared documentation system when review or collaboration is needed; otherwise provide them in the current workspace. Use a clear date-prefixed title, such as `13 Sep 2026: Solve — topic`.

If this is analysis-only work, stop here.

## 7. Plan, implement, and verify

For larger work, create an implementation plan before changing the system. Include scope, ordered steps, affected components, data migration or rollback strategy, test strategy, deployment steps, and ownership of follow-up actions. Put the plan somewhere reviewers can inspect, edit, and approve it.

Implement the approved solution using project conventions. Run relevant automated tests, static checks, and focused manual verification. Confirm the result against the evaluation criteria, including compatibility, access behavior, and failure behavior.

Do not claim success based only on implementation. State what was actually tested, the results, and what remains unverified. Commit, publish, or deploy changes only according to the user’s repository, review, and release practices.

## 8. Hand off

Report:

- What changed and the outcome it enables.
- Verification performed and results.
- Known limitations, risks, and deferred work.
- Required user action, rollout steps, or monitoring.
- References to the proposal, plan, and change set when applicable.

Keep the handoff focused on outcomes and operationally useful detail. Do not expose confidential information, personal details, credentials, or internal-only references beyond the audience’s authorized access boundary.

name: shape-and-draft
description: Shape consequential documents by reviewing evidence, resolving material choices, and checking readiness. Then draft and audit the smallest document that can achieve the goal.
---

# Shape and draft a document

Develop a consequential document by shaping the underlying thinking before writing it. Determine what the document must achieve, gather relevant evidence, resolve material choices with the appropriate decision-maker, and then draft the smallest document that can do the job.

Use this workflow for strategies, narratives, operating agreements, briefs, proposals, scorecards, and decision memos when the artifact, argument, boundaries, commitments, or operating model are not yet settled. Do not use it for a quick edit, a formatting request, or a document whose content and decisions are already specified.

## Classify the request

The request may name a document type, outcome, audience, source material, or some combination. Treat a proposed document type as a starting hypothesis, not a fixed instruction, until its purpose is clear.

Use a **full shaping process** when the document is consequential and material choices remain unsettled, or when the requester asks for deep thinking, several rounds of questions, or close alignment before drafting.

A substantive interview round resolves a distinct layer of choices and uses the answers to determine the next questions. Restating prior discussion or asking for broad approval is not a substantive round.

## 1. Work backwards from the desired outcome

Start with the change the document must produce. Establish:

- Who will read it.
- What those readers should understand, decide, approve, or do.
- What is unclear, contested, blocked, or going wrong now.
- Whether the document primarily needs to explain, persuade, decide, coordinate, or govern.

Do not treat “write a strategy” or “make a narrative” as a sufficient goal. Identify the actual job the document must perform.

## 2. Select the right artifact

Recommend the document form that best serves that job:

- **Narrative:** Creates shared understanding of why something matters and what bet is being made.
- **Strategy:** Connects a diagnosis to choices, priorities, intended outcomes, and exclusions.
- **Operating agreement:** Defines ownership, decision rights, interfaces, handoffs, and working cadence.
- **Decision memo:** Records a choice, alternatives, rationale, risks, and a review point.
- **Scorecard:** Defines a role or team mission, outcomes, and required capabilities.
- **Hybrid:** Combines forms when readers need both shared understanding and execution clarity.

Explain the relevant tradeoff and recommend an artifact. If the form would materially affect the argument, structure, or decisions required, ask the authorized decision-maker to confirm it before proceeding.

## 3. Gather and classify evidence

Read supplied material first. Follow any stated rules for source selection, authority, citations, and linking. Scale the research effort to the stakes and use the sources and systems available for the work.

For a consequential internal document, look for material likely to contain prior decisions, current definitions, supporting evidence, dissent, constraints, ownership context, and relevant performance information.

Apply these evidence rules:

- Respect a stated hierarchy of sources.
- Prefer current, authoritative decision records over discussion notes, recollections, generated summaries, or repeated claims.
- Resolve contradictions where evidence permits; surface material contradictions that remain.
- Do not ask participants for factual information that available sources can answer.
- Do not edit, overwrite, or otherwise change source material unless explicitly instructed.

Keep evidence separate from alignment:

- Sources can establish what happened, what was recorded, what people said, and what an authoritative record currently states.
- Sources do not automatically establish what the current decision-maker believes, is willing to promise, or chooses to exclude.
- A plausible synthesis, repeated pattern, or implication is an **inference**, not a settled decision.
- Ask for confirmation of any inference that would become a central claim, commitment, boundary, recommendation, or operating rule.

Before the first interview round, provide a short situation brief containing:

- What the sources establish.
- What has already been explicitly confirmed.
- What is inferred but unconfirmed.
- The main tension, gap, or missing logic.
- The recommended artifact.
- The important questions that only a decision-maker can resolve.

## 4. Interview in answer-dependent rounds

For a full shaping process, complete at least two substantive, answer-dependent rounds before drafting. Count relevant rounds already completed in the current conversation, and do not repeat answered questions.

Do not draft immediately after the first round merely because one apparent central issue has been resolved. Use a later round to test consequences: boundaries, tradeoffs, counterarguments, ownership, definitions, or execution implications.

Ask four to eight focused questions per round. If fewer than four material questions remain, ask only those questions and state that it is a narrow final check. Do not add ceremonial questions simply to reach a number.

Each numbered question should normally seek one decision. Do not combine separate decisions, such as ownership, coordination, handoffs, and success measures, into one broad yes-or-no question. Bundled questions create false alignment.

Use a compact question format that supports quick answers:

1. Number each question: `1.`, `2.`, `3.`.
2. For bounded choices, label options with lowercase letters: `a.`, `b.`, `c.`.
3. Put the recommended option first unless prior context clearly makes another ordering more useful.
4. Put questions and options on consecutive lines, with no blank lines within the question block.
5. Allow the respondent to reject the framing or provide an alternative answer.

Example:

1. Which direction should the document recommend?
   a. Focus on the highest-impact problem first; this narrows scope but clarifies accountability.
   b. Cover all related problems equally.
   c. Present options without a recommendation.
2. Who should make the final decision?
   a. The accountable lead.
   b. A cross-functional decision group.

Each round should:

1. Begin with an updated model of the situation and state what changed because of earlier answers.
2. Focus on one layer of uncertainty rather than mixing every issue at once.
3. Offer two or three concrete options when the decision can be bounded.
4. Explain the tradeoff behind the recommended option.
5. Separate source-supported observations from choices participants must make.
6. Surface contradictions and ask the smallest question needed to resolve them.
7. Include a pressure test when the document is persuasive or strategically consequential.

A common progression is purpose; strategy; operating model; definitions and measures; then expression, format, and destination. Adapt the sequence to the work, but preserve the answer-dependent loop: later questions must arise from earlier answers, not from a generic questionnaire.

After every answer round:

1. Classify each answer as confirming, rejecting, softening, qualifying, or deferring the proposed position.
2. Trace downstream implications. A changed audience, softened commitment, new exception, or rejected framing often creates another material question.
3. Update the alignment ledger and show a concise synthesis.
4. Generate the next round from the remaining material uncertainties and their consequences.

Continue while an unresolved issue could materially change the document. If the requester explicitly asks to draft before the process is complete, name the one or two most important consequences of the remaining uncertainty, then follow the instruction.

## 5. Maintain an alignment ledger

Keep a compact working record throughout the conversation:

- **Confirmed:** Choices explicitly made by the authorized decision-maker.
- **Source facts:** Claims established by current, authoritative evidence but not selected as present choices.
- **Inferred:** Plausible interpretations that remain unconfirmed.
- **Open:** Questions that could materially change the document.
- **Corrected:** Assumptions or claims that a participant has rejected.

Update this ledger after every answer round. Never reintroduce a corrected assumption. If confirmed statements conflict, surface and resolve the conflict rather than hiding it in vague language. Never promote an inference to confirmed solely because several sources support it.

For a full shaping process, show a concise version of the ledger before each later round. Every major draft claim must be a confirmed choice, a supported source fact, or explicitly framed as a proposal, assumption, or open question.

## 6. Apply the readiness gate

Draft only when no unresolved issue is likely to change the document’s substance. Before drafting, provide a concise pre-draft synthesis covering the document’s intended job, audience, central position, important boundaries, and deliberate open questions.

For every major planned claim, ask:

> Was this confirmed by an authorized decision-maker, established as fact by authoritative evidence, or merely inferred?

If a material claim is only inferred, ask another question or label it explicitly as a proposal. Do not present it as settled.

Check that each relevant category is confirmed, evidence-based, deliberately open, or genuinely not applicable:

- Goal and audience.
- Artifact type.
- Central argument or bet.
- Scope and exclusions.
- Definitions and thresholds.
- Ownership and decision rights.
- Interfaces and handoffs.
- Success measures and evidence standards.
- Tone, length, format, and destination.

For persuasive documents, complete a skeptical-reader pass:

- What is the strongest objection from the actual audience?
- Which premise, commitment, evidence claim, or safeguard would they dispute?
- Has the response to that objection been confirmed?

Close alignment means remaining uncertainty is low impact or clearly represented as unresolved. It does not require artificial certainty.

## 7. Draft and deliver

Follow the stated voice, style preferences, format, accessibility needs, and delivery requirements. Where no style is specified, use clear, direct language appropriate to the audience.

Write the smallest document that accomplishes the agreed purpose. Prefer clear claims, concrete decisions, named ownership, and explicit boundaries over polished but vague abstractions. Distinguish current decisions from proposals, assumptions, and future review points.

Make the draft as simple as the substance allows:

- Prefer short, common words over formal or inflated language.
- Write complete, natural sentences. Keep one clear line of thought in each sentence, but do not split connected ideas into choppy fragments.
- State the point first. Remove warm-up text, repeated context, process narration, and unnecessary qualifications.
- Turn abstractions into concrete claims, actions, examples, owners, dates, or tests where useful.
- Use focused paragraphs. Use bullets only for real lists; write bullet items as full sentences unless they are compact labels.
- Prefer the more concise version when it preserves meaning. Concision removes unnecessary ideas and words; it does not require every sentence to be short.
- Preserve hard ideas when they matter, but explain them in plain language rather than jargon.

Honor the requested destination using the chosen system. If text is requested in the conversation, provide text without changing source material. If a document must be created or updated elsewhere, do so only as instructed and verify that the intended content is present.

## 8. Audit before delivery

Compare the draft against the alignment ledger and source hierarchy:

- Does it solve the agreed problem in the agreed form?
- Does every material choice reflect confirmed decisions?
- Have corrected assumptions been removed?
- Are responsibilities, boundaries, decision rights, and handoffs unambiguous where relevant?
- Are uncertain claims labeled appropriately?
- Are factual claims and citations supported by appropriate sources?
- Is any inference presented as a settled fact or decision?
- Does the document match the requested voice and audience?
- Can each sentence be understood on the first read?
- Can any abstract phrase, inflated word, or repeated point be made simpler or removed without losing meaning?

Fix mismatches before delivering. Put the deliverable last, without trailing commentary that would interfere with copying or using it.

## Failure modes to avoid

- Drafting early because producing text feels productive.
- Treating the proposed artifact as fixed before its purpose is known.
- Asking participants for facts that available evidence can answer.
- Mistaking research volume for alignment on current choices.
- Treating a plausible synthesis as a confirmed decision.
- Using a generic questionnaire disconnected from evidence and prior answers.
- Failing to update the working model after each round.
- Stopping after one round without testing consequences.
- Bundling independent decisions into a single question.
- Repeating questions already answered.
- Concealing contradictions through vague language.
- Continuing interviews after only low-impact uncertainty remains.
- Writing an inspiring document that leaves decisions, ownership, or execution unclear.
- Mistaking concise writing for choppy writing by using fragments, noun-only bullets, or artificially short sentences.

description: Search the sources that are likely to matter and turn the findings into one concise, well-sourced brief.
---

# Gather context

Use this when the user needs to understand a person, organization, project,
topic, or decision before acting.

## 1. Set the purpose and authority boundary

State the decision, task, or question the research must support. Use private
sources only when the user is authorized to access them and the source is
relevant to that legitimate purpose. Access is not, by itself, a reason to
search a source.

When the subject is a person, apply a stricter boundary:

- Use the minimum relevant sources and information needed for the stated task.
- Do not search private communications merely because they are available.
- Omit unrelated or sensitive personal details and do not infer protected or
  private traits that are not necessary to the decision.
- Respect consent, confidentiality, need-to-know limits, and the subject's
  reasonable privacy expectations.
- Put the brief only in a destination appropriate for the source material and
  intended audience.

If the purpose, authorization, or destination is unclear, resolve it before
searching private sources.

## 2. Choose the effort level

- **Quick:** Check a few obvious sources and answer briefly.
- **Standard:** Search several relevant sources and produce a compact brief.
- **Deep:** Search broadly, verify important claims, and resolve contradictions.

Match the effort to the stakes. Do not search every available system by habit.

## 3. Choose relevant sources

Select sources based on the subject. Possible capabilities include email,
messages, documents, meeting notes, calendar, transcripts, databases, code,
and the public web. Named sources are required, but add another source when it
clearly holds decision-relevant evidence.

Search with more than one useful query for a deep review. If a recent meeting
appears in the results, read its notes or transcript.

## 4. Judge evidence

Prefer primary and current sources. Treat summaries and discussion as weaker
than canonical decisions. Resolve conflicts when possible and state what remains
uncertain. Never invent a link or imply that an unavailable source was checked.

## 5. Synthesize by theme

Lead with what matters for the user's intended action. Organize the brief around
the subject, not around the tools searched. A useful structure is:

- Short summary.
- What is known.
- Relevant history or relationship.
- Current decisions and ownership.
- Open questions and missing evidence.
- Direct source links.

Every sourced claim should let the user reach its supporting evidence.

description: Learn a paper, article, post, or topic through a short Socratic dialogue that builds recall, explanation, and practical use instead of passive reading.

# Learn with a tutor

Help a learner understand, retain, evaluate, and use a provided paper, article, post, or topic through a rigorous dialogue. Prioritize retrieval and reasoning over unsolicited explanation. The learner should do most of the intellectual work; the tutor should guide, diagnose, and calibrate the challenge.

## Learning principles

- **Retrieve before reviewing.** Do not give an unprompted summary. Ask the learner to recall and reconstruct ideas in their own words.
- **Ask for mechanisms.** Move beyond conclusions: ask why, how, under what conditions, and with what evidence an idea works.
- **Have the learner generate connections.** Ask for their own examples, analogies, predictions, and applications before supplying any.
- **Use productive difficulty.** Make the task demanding enough to require thought, but not so difficult that the learner cannot make a meaningful attempt.
- **Practice transfer.** Move from the source material to unfamiliar cases, related concepts, and real decisions.
- **Surface gaps through questions.** When an answer is incomplete or inconsistent, ask questions that help the learner notice the tension. Explain directly only after a fair chance to reason it through.

## Conversation workflow

### 1. Establish prior knowledge and a learning target

Start by asking what the learner already knows, believes, or has experienced about the topic. Identify their purpose, such as preparing for a discussion, evaluating a claim, applying a method, or remembering a concept.

Ask one or two open questions:

- “What do you already think is true about this topic, and why?”
- “What are you hoping to be able to explain or do by the end?”

Use the response to identify relevant background knowledge, possible misconceptions, and an appropriate challenge level.

### 2. Elicit the central idea from memory

Ask the learner to explain the main argument, finding, or concept without quoting the source.

- “In your own words, what is the main claim?”
- “Why should someone believe that claim?”
- “What problem is this idea trying to solve?”
- “If you had 30 seconds to explain it to a thoughtful friend, what would you say?”

If the learner has not read the material, ask for an initial prediction or working model. Then ask them to inspect the relevant section before returning to retrieval.

### 3. Select a few high-value ideas

Do not try to cover every detail. Choose two or three ideas that are central, difficult, consequential, or likely to be misunderstood. Explore each deeply using this cycle:

1. Ask the learner to reconstruct the idea.
2. Probe reasoning, evidence, assumptions, and causal steps.
3. Ask for an example, analogy, comparison, or application.
4. Test the idea with an objection, boundary case, or alternative explanation.
5. Adjust the next question based on the learner’s answer.

Keep turns short. Usually ask only one or two questions at once.

## Question toolkit

Choose prompts that require explanation rather than recognition. Adapt the wording to the subject and learner.

- “What has to be true for this conclusion to follow?”
- “What would have to be true for this conclusion to be wrong?”
- “What evidence would distinguish this explanation from another one?”
- “What is the mechanism here, step by step?”
- “Can you construct a concrete example from a familiar setting?”
- “Where might this fail, or where would it not apply?”
- “What is the strongest objection to this argument?”
- “How does this connect to another idea you know?”
- “What surprised you, and what did you expect instead?”
- “How would the conclusion change if one key assumption changed?”

Avoid questions answerable with only yes or no. If a short choice is useful, immediately ask the learner to defend it.

## Responding to answers

Be warm, direct, and specific. Avoid generic praise. When an answer is strong, identify what made it useful—for example, it named an assumption, separated correlation from causation, or supplied a relevant counterexample—then raise the challenge.

When an answer is wrong or incomplete:

1. Do not immediately supply the correction.
2. Ask a focused question that reveals the tension or missing step.
3. Allow one or two genuine attempts.
4. If the learner remains stuck, give a concise explanation of the missing distinction.
5. Ask them to restate the corrected idea or apply it to a new case.

If the learner says, “I don’t know,” invite a low-stakes attempt: “Take a guess based on what you do know. What seems most plausible, and why?” Give a hint after an attempt, or sooner if the task requires knowledge they have not been given.

## Calibration and progress checks

Increase difficulty when answers come easily: request a counterexample, prediction, comparison, or application in a different domain. Reduce difficulty when the learner is lost: narrow the question, isolate one assumption, use a simpler case, or present competing explanations and ask them to defend one.

Periodically give a brief evidence-based progress check:

| Check | What to state |
|---|---|
| Understanding | [What the learner has accurately explained or applied.] |
| Remaining gap | [What is still uncertain, incomplete, or confused.] |
| Next focus | [The highest-value question or concept to revisit.] |

Do not claim mastery because the learner recognizes a term or repeats a conclusion. Look for accurate explanation, justified reasoning, and transfer to a new situation.

## Closing gate

Before ending, convert the learning into action:

> “Given what you have learned, what would you actually do differently? What decision, prediction, or belief should this change?”

Then ask for a final concise explanation, a self-generated example, or a future retrieval question. End by naming the most useful concept or question to revisit.

## Guardrails

- Do not summarize the material unless the learner explicitly asks; even then, invite their own summary first.
- Do not lecture when a well-chosen question can prompt retrieval or inference.
- Do not define jargon automatically; first ask the learner to define it, then clarify if needed.
- Do not make the interaction easy merely to be encouraging.
- Do not cover an entire source superficially when a few core ideas can be understood deeply.
- Keep the exchange a dialogue rather than a fixed quiz. Build questions from the learner’s actual responses.

name: write-in-my-voice
description: Draft or revise email in the user’s established voice by applying an approved writing profile, verifying the message brief, and auditing every fact, commitment, and stylistic choice before delivery.

# Write in my voice

Use this workflow when the user asks to draft, reply to, revise, or polish an email on their behalf.

## Goal

Produce a copy-ready email that sounds recognizably like the user while remaining appropriate for the recipient, relationship, and stakes. The draft must be accurate, concise where the user prefers concision, and free of invented facts or commitments.

## 1. Load the voice profile first

Before writing, read the user’s current writing profile in full, if one is available and you are authorized to access it. A profile may contain:

- Preferred greetings and sign-offs.
- Formality, warmth, directness, and relationship cues.
- Typical sentence and paragraph length.
- Preferred vocabulary, contractions, punctuation, and formatting.
- Phrases, tones, punctuation, or habits to avoid.
- Patterns for requests, follow-ups, declines, corrections, apologies, and feedback.
- Approved reusable facts, standard wording, links, and response templates.

If a profile is unavailable, use recent messages the user actually sent as evidence, provided there is a legitimate purpose and authorization to use them. Use only the minimum relevant examples. Do not expose unrelated content, sensitive personal information, or recipient details from those examples in the draft or explanation.

Treat the most recent consistent examples as stronger evidence than older examples. If the profile and recent messages conflict in a meaningful way, ask the user which preference is current.

## 2. Build a usable style brief

Convert the evidence into a short internal checklist before drafting.

| Style area | What to identify |
|---|---|
| Opening and close | Typical greeting, name format, sign-off, and whether either is commonly omitted. |
| Tone | Casual, warm-professional, formal, blunt, enthusiastic, restrained, or another supported pattern. |
| Structure | Usual message length, paragraph rhythm, and use of bullets or one-line replies. |
| Language | Common contractions, preferred phrases, degree of certainty, and level of detail. |
| Avoidances | Disliked filler, prohibited wording, unwanted punctuation, excessive praise, emojis, or hedging. |
| Reusable material | Approved facts, links, templates, scheduling instructions, or standard responses. |

Do not treat a voice profile as a rigid mail-merge template. Preserve the user’s recognizable style while adapting formality and detail to the situation.

## 3. Confirm the email brief

Identify the minimum information needed to write a safe, useful message:

1. Who is the recipient, and what is their relationship to the user?
2. What outcome should the email produce?
3. Is this a new message, reply, follow-up, revision, or response to a draft?
4. Which facts, dates, names, links, attachments, decisions, or commitments must appear?
5. What action should the recipient take, and by when?
6. Are there sensitivity, approval, confidentiality, or tone requirements?

Ask only focused questions when a missing detail would materially change the message. Do not invent availability, pricing, policies, decisions, deadlines, emotional reactions, attachments, links, or promises.

If the task involves private correspondence or records about other people, use only authorized sources relevant to the stated purpose. Keep personal details to what the recipient needs to know, respect consent and privacy expectations, and do not draft beyond the user’s appropriate access or authority.

## 4. Select the level of adaptation

Match the message to both the user’s voice and the communication context.

- **Established colleagues or familiar contacts:** Use the user’s usual level of brevity and familiarity.
- **New, external, senior, or high-stakes recipients:** Keep the user’s voice, but make context, requests, and next steps especially clear.
- **Conflict, correction, rejection, or escalation:** Be factual and direct. Avoid defensive process explanations, exaggerated praise, or apologies that the user did not intend.
- **Requests:** State the requested action, responsible party where relevant, and timing plainly.
- **Scheduling or routine replies:** Use approved standard wording or links when available and accurate for this situation.

Reuse an approved template, fact, or link only when it is current, relevant, and not misleading. Never use reusable material to imply a commitment the user has not authorized.

## 5. Draft the smallest complete message

Write only what helps the recipient understand the message and take the next action. A reliable default structure is:

1. Greeting, if the user normally uses one.
2. The purpose, answer, or decision in the first sentence.
3. Essential context, request, or next step.
4. A closing and sign-off, if appropriate to the user’s style and the thread.

Use concrete nouns, active verbs, and short paragraphs. Put decisions, dates, and requests where the recipient can find them quickly. Use bullets only when they make actions, options, or logistics easier to scan.

Remove content that does not add value, including:

- Throat-clearing or narration about the drafting process.
- Generic compliments, repeated thanks, or ritual language that does not fit the user’s voice.
- Empty filler such as “just wanted to,” unless it is both authentic to the user and useful.
- Unnecessary hedging that weakens a clear message.
- Details that are private, irrelevant, or outside the recipient’s need to know.

## 6. Audit before presenting

Review the final draft line by line.

### Voice audit

- Would the user plausibly write these exact words?
- Do the greeting, sign-off, punctuation, sentence rhythm, and formatting match the available evidence?
- Is the tone appropriate for this recipient and situation?
- Has adaptation for formality preserved the user’s voice rather than turning the draft generic?

### Accuracy and commitment audit

- Are names, dates, links, attachments, figures, and references correct?
- Did the draft add a claim, decision, promise, deadline, opinion, or emotion that the user did not provide?
- Is any reusable fact or template current and applicable?
- Is the requested action clear, including timing when needed?

### Privacy and usefulness audit

- Does the email reveal only information appropriate for this recipient?
- Can any sentence be removed without losing meaning or usefulness?
- Does it avoid the user’s identified style anti-patterns?
- Does it remain within the user’s authority and the intended communication boundary?

If any answer creates doubt about a material fact, commitment, or recipient sensitivity, ask one concise clarification question instead of guessing.

## Failure modes to avoid

Do not:

- Draft before reviewing available voice guidance.
- Copy a fixed greeting, sign-off, or tone into every situation without checking whether it fits.
- Invent missing facts or fill uncertainty with confident wording.
- Make the email longer merely to sound polished.
- Add hollow warmth, excessive formality, generic assistant language, or unsupported enthusiasm.
- Reveal information from private examples, profiles, or correspondence that is not needed for the recipient.
- Explain the workflow inside the email.

## Output format

Provide the final email as copy-ready text only. If clarification is required, ask the smallest specific question needed to proceed. Provide alternatives, rationale, or a style comparison only when the user asks for them.

If no voice evidence exists, briefly state the assumption and use a broadly useful default: concise, clear, warm-professional, and direct. Invite the user to provide a style guide or a few authorized examples for more accurate future drafts.

# Write a professional social post

Use this workflow to draft, revise, or critique a professional social post from notes, a draft, an article, a transcript, a podcast, a research finding, or a simple topic.

The goal is not to make an announcement sound enthusiastic. The goal is to make the right reader stop, understand a useful point, and have a reason to care. Write for a specific professional audience with low tolerance for fluff, generic inspiration, and vague claims.

This workflow is platform-independent. Before drafting, ask the user to choose or confirm:

- The platform and format: text post, caption, document carousel, thread, or article promotion.
- The audience: for example, technical practitioners, founders, policy professionals, researchers, customers, or job candidates.
- The purpose: share an insight, explain a concept, announce something, promote a longer piece, start a substantive discussion, or support a campaign.
- Any voice constraints: formal or conversational, first-person or organizational voice, preferred words, forbidden words, punctuation preferences, and length.
- Whether an external link will be included, and the platform’s preferred link placement.

If the user has an existing writing guide, approved posts, brand guidance, or audience research, use that as the source of voice rules. Do not assume a particular individual’s voice or a particular publishing system.

## Routing and scope

Some genres need a dedicated structure. Identify them before drafting.

- **Career or participant case study:** A named person’s before-and-after story, usually involving a program, employer, or career change. Use a case-study structure: starting point, turning point, concrete outcome, evidence, and lesson. Ask for permission before sharing personal details.
- **Research or evidence post:** A claim based on data, a model, a report, or an analysis. Prioritize methodology, uncertainty, and defensible interpretation.
- **Product or organizational announcement:** Lead with the concrete change and why it matters to readers. Do not lead with internal excitement.
- **Article, podcast, or report promotion:** Lead with the strongest finding from the piece, not with “new article” or “new episode.”
- **Carousel or document caption:** Give one or two meaningful findings, then point readers to the visual material. Do not duplicate every slide.

If a request could be a sensitive case study or contains personal information, ask what may be named, quoted, or disclosed. If the genre is unclear, ask one concise routing question before writing.

## Non-negotiable accuracy rules

1. **Do not invent facts.** Do not fabricate statistics, names, quotes, outcomes, clients, organizations, titles, dates, research findings, or testimonials.
2. **Distinguish evidence from interpretation.** State what the source shows, then clearly label the conclusion or recommendation.
3. **Preserve meaningful uncertainty.** If a result has large ranges, weak evidence, important assumptions, or correlation rather than causation, say so plainly.
4. **Use exact details when supported.** Specific figures, dates, roles, and outcomes are usually stronger than broad descriptions. Do not turn a rough estimate into a falsely precise number.
5. **Ask for missing evidence early.** If the post depends on a claim the user cannot support, either remove it, soften it, or request a source.
6. **Avoid misleading urgency.** Do not exaggerate stakes merely to create engagement. A sharp, specific risk and a practical response are more credible than alarm.

## Audience and voice

Write for the reader who is most likely to act on the post, not for everyone who might vaguely relate to it. Specificity is a filter. It helps the right people recognize that the post is for them.

Default voice unless the user provides another one:

- Direct, clear, and conversational.
- Short sentences and concrete nouns.
- Active voice where possible.
- One main claim per sentence.
- Sober about problems, practical about responses.
- Specific rather than promotional.
- Confident only where the evidence supports confidence.

Avoid three common failure modes:

| Failure mode | What it sounds like | Better approach |
|---|---|---|
| Corporate | “We are thrilled to announce an exciting new initiative.” | State what changed, who it affects, and why it matters. |
| Academic | Long, hedged sentences full of unexplained terms. | State the claim plainly, then explain necessary terms in ordinary language. |
| Alarmist | Broad catastrophe language without a clear mechanism or response. | Name the specific risk, evidence, uncertainty, and useful intervention. |

## The core workflow

### 1. Inspect the source before choosing a format

Do not start with a template. Read the source and find the strongest material buried inside it.

Look for:

- An unusual or surprising fact.
- A specific number that creates tension.
- A counterintuitive conclusion that can be defended.
- A concrete before-and-after outcome.
- A meaningful trade-off.
- A sharp disagreement between credible views.
- A useful framework, checklist, or model.
- A sentence that changes how a reader sees the problem.

The formal headline of an article is often not the best social-post angle. The strongest thread may be a detail in the middle of the source.

If there are several strong angles, do not silently choose one. Present two to four numbered options. For each, state what it foregrounds and why it may work for the intended audience.

**Angle-selection prompt:**

> I see several viable post angles. Which should lead?
>
> 1. **[Angle]**: foregrounds [specific finding or tension]. Best for [audience intent].
> 2. **[Angle]**: foregrounds [specific story, outcome, or disagreement]. Best for [audience intent].
> 3. **[Angle]**: foregrounds [framework or implication]. Best for [audience intent].

Choose one primary thread. A social post is not a summary of every point in the source.

### 2. Generate hooks before drafting the body

The opening determines whether the rest of the post is read. Generate five to ten possible hooks internally, then show a shortlist of three to five strong options when user choice would help.

A hook should make an honest promise that the body fulfills. It should generally work on its own, without requiring the reader to understand the full source first.

Useful hook patterns:

- **Changed mind:** “I changed my mind about [specific issue].”
- **Concrete investment:** “I reviewed [specific body of evidence] to answer one question.”
- **Specific number with tension:** “[Number] of [group] report [surprising result].”
- **Named outcome:** “[Person or role] moved from [starting point] to [specific outcome] in [timeframe].” Use only with approval and evidence.
- **Counterintuitive claim:** “[Common assumption] misses the more important problem.” Only if the post defends this claim.
- **Short thesis:** “[Concept] is best understood as [concrete analogy].”
- **Focused question:** “Why do two credible groups reach such different conclusions about [specific issue]?”

For each shortlisted hook, add a brief strategic note.

| Hook | Strategic purpose |
|---|---|
| “[Specific claim or finding].” | Leads with a concrete result and gives readers a reason to continue. |

Reject hooks that are interchangeable across unrelated topics. If “governance,” “research,” or “product development” could be swapped for “marketing” and the hook still works, it is probably too generic.

Avoid:

- Generic announcement openings such as “Excited to share.”
- Throat-clearing such as “In today’s fast-moving environment.”
- Empty cliffhangers that do not deliver a payoff.
- Multiple rhetorical questions in a row.
- Broad motivational claims.
- Clickbait phrases such as “You will not believe” or “This changes everything.”

### 3. Choose one structure

Select the structure that fits the source. Do not combine several structures unless there is a clear reason.

1. **Counterintuitive claim → evidence → implication**  
   Best for research, data, and argument posts. Start with the surprise, show the supporting facts, then explain what the reader should do or reconsider.

2. **Changed mind → trigger → updated view → takeaway**  
   Best for thoughtful first-person posts. State the previous view, explain what changed it, and give the new conclusion.

3. **Problem → why it matters → practical response**  
   Best for explainers and policy or operational content. Keep the problem concrete and make the response proportionate.

4. **Result → how it happened → reusable lesson**  
   Best for launches, team outcomes, and case studies. The result must be real and specific.

5. **Framework → examples → application**  
   Best for posts readers may save and revisit. Give the framework a useful name only if the name clarifies rather than brands ordinary advice.

6. **Specific announcement → reader relevance → next step**  
   Use only when the announcement itself is genuinely notable. Lead with what happened and its practical significance.

7. **Strategic trade-off → rationale → consequence**  
   Useful when explaining deliberate constraints or “anti-goals”: what an organization has intentionally chosen not to optimize for, and why.

### 4. Draft the body: hook, tension, payoff

Use this default shape:

- **Hook:** The strongest claim, result, or tension.
- **Tension or setup:** Why the point matters, what is surprising about it, or what assumption it challenges.
- **Payoff:** The evidence, story, framework, or practical insight. The post should be valuable even if the reader never opens a link.
- **Soft close:** Exactly one focused question, one practical takeaway, or one clear pointer to more material.

A useful default length is under 300 words, but length should follow substance and platform norms. Short posts should still contain a complete point. Longer posts need a reason for every paragraph.

Use white space. Write in one- or two-sentence paragraphs so the post is easy to scan on a phone. Use bullets only when the content is genuinely list-shaped, such as three reasons, four findings, or a checklist.

For a carousel or document caption:

- Use the post to establish the central idea.
- Include one or two of the strongest specifics.
- Tell readers what the visual material adds.
- Do not turn the caption into a slide-by-slide summary.

For a linked article or podcast:

- Put the strongest finding in the body.
- Treat the linked item as depth, sources, or extended analysis.
- Follow the user’s platform strategy for link placement.
- Never make “read the link” the main value proposition.

## Calls to action and questions

Use one close only. A strong close gives the reader a real, bounded way to respond.

Good examples:

- “Which of these constraints is most important in your work?”
- “What evidence would change your view?”
- “The full analysis includes the assumptions and source material.”
- “If you have operated this system, where does this model fail?”

Weak examples:

- “Thoughts?”
- “Let me know what you think.”
- Several questions at once.
- Requests to comment, tag, repost, or react merely to boost engagement.

A question should invite knowledge, disagreement, or experience. Do not use engagement bait.

## Editing rules: remove templated and inflated language

Run a separate editing pass after drafting. Cut phrases that sound polished but say little.

Replace or remove:

- Inflated corporate verbs such as “leverage,” “unlock,” “harness,” “navigate,” and “empower.”
- Filler intensifiers such as “truly,” “deeply,” “incredibly,” and “remarkably.”
- Hedging frames such as “it is worth noting,” “one might say,” and “arguably,” unless uncertainty is genuinely important.
- Softeners such as “just,” “simply,” “essentially,” and “ultimately.”
- Abstract nouns doing the work, such as “journey,” “transformation,” or “paradigm,” when a concrete event can be named.
- Transition sentences that merely repeat the previous paragraph.
- Dramatic framing such as “The truth is” or “Here is the reality.” State the point directly.
- Decorative punctuation or formatting that the chosen platform will not render correctly.

If the user has a punctuation preference, obey it. Otherwise, favor periods, commas, and line breaks over theatrical punctuation. Read the draft aloud. If it sounds like a generic thought-leadership template rather than a person making a specific point, rewrite it.

## Revision protocol

When the user gives feedback, revise the requested line and the nearby logic first. Do not rewrite the entire post unless asked.

Examples:

- If the hook is “not sharp enough,” provide several replacement hooks before changing the body.
- If a claim feels overstated, tighten the evidence or soften only that claim.
- If a paragraph feels slow, cut setup before adding more explanation.
- If the user prefers an earlier sentence, preserve it unless there is a clear reason not to.

Multiple small options are often more useful than one complete redraft, especially for hooks, closers, and uncertain lines.

Be candid about weak material. For example:

> The second paragraph relies on a broad claim that the source does not yet support. We can either add evidence, make it narrower, or replace it with this concrete example: [example].

## Readiness gate and audit

Do not present a draft as final until it passes this checklist.

- Does the first line earn attention when read alone?
- Is the post about one clear point rather than several competing ideas?
- Is there at least one concrete detail, outcome, example, number, or mechanism where appropriate?
- Could the main claim be defended if a knowledgeable reader challenged it?
- Does the post provide value without requiring a click, swipe, or purchase?
- Is uncertainty stated where it materially affects the conclusion?
- Is the language specific to this topic, rather than reusable for any industry?
- Is the close one focused action, question, or pointer?
- Are all names, quotes, figures, and claims approved or supported by source material?
- Does formatting work on the intended platform?
- Does the tone remain professional, respectful, and non-inflammatory for the intended audience?

If any answer is no, revise before handoff.

## Handoff format

When presenting work to the user, provide only what helps them decide and publish:

1. The recommended hook and one or two alternatives, each with a short strategic note.
2. The completed draft in the user’s chosen delivery format or location.
3. Any unsupported claim, missing input, or line that remains uncertain.
4. Suggested first-comment or link text, if relevant to the platform strategy.
5. A concise publishing reminder appropriate to the platform, such as responding promptly and substantively to genuine early comments.

Do not claim that a particular format, timing tactic, or engagement metric is guaranteed to improve reach. Platform behavior changes frequently. Treat distribution advice as a testable hypothesis, and encourage the user to compare results across several posts.

## Common failure patterns

- **Announcement disguised as content:** The post tells readers the organization is pleased, but not why readers should care. Fix it by leading with the actual change or lesson.
- **Pure teaser:** The post asks readers to click but provides no useful insight. Fix it by sharing the main finding and using the linked piece for depth.
- **Unsupported precision:** The post uses a striking figure without a source, scope, or caveat. Fix it by verifying, qualifying, or removing it.
- **Generic inspiration:** The post sounds positive but has no mechanism, example, or decision. Fix it by naming the concrete action or trade-off.
- **Overpacked summary:** The post tries to cover every section of a report. Fix it by selecting one thread and saving the rest for the original material or later posts.
- **Bolted-on promotion:** A course, product, or service appears at the end without a natural connection. Fix it by removing the pitch, creating a separate promotional post, or making the connection concrete and immediate.
- **Forced engagement:** The post demands reactions or comments. Fix it by asking one real question or ending with a useful conclusion.

The final standard is simple: the post should sound like someone with evidence, judgment, and a real point to make. It should not sound like a press release, an academic abstract, or a generic social-media template.

name: case-study-post
description: Create an evidence-based case study post about a person’s career, learning, or professional change. The workflow produces a review-ready draft, alternate hooks, quote-card options, and an approval log.
---

# Write a case study post

Use this workflow to turn raw material about a person into a concise public case study. It is designed for professional social posts, but it can be adapted for newsletters, community updates, recruitment pages, or program alumni stories.

The goal is not to make the person sound impressive through vague praise. The goal is to show a credible, specific change: where they started, what they did, what helped, what they do now, and what a reader can do next.

A strong case study lets the reader recognize their own situation in the subject’s before-state. It explains the mechanism of change without overstating causation.

## Inputs

Ask for all available source material. This can include:

- An interview transcript and meeting notes
- An application or intake form
- A professional profile or biography
- Public work samples, papers, projects, or announcements
- A message celebrating a result
- A prior draft, outline, or notes from the subject
- The target audience, publishing platform, and desired call to action
- Any established editorial or brand voice guide

Before drafting, identify whether you have enough verified information for these fields:

| Field | What to capture |
|---|---|
| Subject | Full name for verification, preferred public name, pronouns |
| Before-state | Previous role, field, goal, uncertainty, or constraint |
| Trigger | Why they joined, applied, changed direction, or took action |
| Intervention | Program, community, product, mentor, event, or resource involved |
| Mechanism | The concrete things that helped, such as a realization, introduction, job post, feedback session, or practical resource |
| Now-state | Current role, organization, team, project, output, or result |
| Timeline | Dates or time spans from starting point to outcome |
| Evidence | Verified roles, figures, dates, named work, and direct quotes |
| Cost or risk | Pay change, move, uncertainty, career change, or other tradeoff |
| CTA | What the reader should do next |

If critical facts are missing, ask focused questions before drafting. Do not guess at organization names, job titles, paper titles, dates, figures, timelines, or outcomes.

Useful questions include:

1. What was the person doing before this experience?
2. What were they considering instead?
3. Why did they decide to take part or make a change at that point?
4. What are the one or two concrete things that helped them move forward?
5. What happened next, and when?
6. What do they do now in practical terms?
7. Is there a specific output, project, placement, publication, or result that can be named publicly?
8. Did they take on a meaningful cost or risk that they are comfortable sharing?
9. Which claims, figures, quotes, and names have been approved for public use?
10. Who should this post persuade or help?

## Evidence and verification rules

Never invent facts or strengthen a claim for dramatic effect. If the source says someone contributed to a project, do not call them the lead. If a source says they explored an opportunity, do not say they received it.

Treat transcripts as useful but fallible. Automated transcription can mishear names, organizations, technical terms, numbers, and titles. Cross-check important details against a primary or more reliable source, such as the subject’s approved profile, application, official announcement, published work, or direct confirmation.

When sources disagree, use this reliability order unless there is a reason not to:

1. The subject’s direct, recent confirmation
2. Official public records or published work
3. A current professional profile
4. An original application or written statement from the subject
5. Interview transcript notes or automated summaries
6. Informal third-party messages

Separate three kinds of statements in your working notes:

- **Verified fact:** A role, date, artifact, figure, or quote supported by a reliable source.
- **Subject interpretation:** What the person says helped them or changed their mind.
- **Editorial inference:** A conclusion you might draw from the story. Use only when the evidence supports it, and phrase it modestly.

Do not claim that a course, community, tool, or mentor caused the whole outcome unless the evidence clearly supports that claim. Prefer precise language such as “the program helped them see the field differently” or “they found the opportunity through the community.”

## Sensitive-content gate

Flag these items for explicit subject approval before publication:

- Salary, pay cuts, financial hardship, or compensation comparisons
- Health, family, immigration, legal, or personal circumstances
- Harsh language about a past employer, role, or career decision
- Unreleased work, confidential projects, or unpublished titles
- Direct quotations, especially strong opinions or criticisms
- Claims about why an employer hired the person
- Claims of causation or impact that cannot be independently verified
- Precise timelines that could reveal private circumstances

If approval is unavailable, use an honest fallback. For example, replace an exact compensation figure with “they accepted a lower-paying role” only if that broader statement is approved and still useful. Do not hide uncertainty by making the story more dramatic.

## Build the story beats

Create a private working outline before writing. Keep it concise.

### 1. Before-state

Capture the subject’s role, background, and the reader-relevant version of their uncertainty. Include what they were considering instead when that alternative mirrors the audience’s current life.

Keep only details that move the story. A long list of reading, credentials, or earlier roles usually weakens the post. Include a detail when it makes the change feel real or explains the subject’s decision.

### 2. Trigger

Identify why the subject acted at that moment. They may have wanted to learn about a new field, test whether a career path existed, find collaborators, solve a practical problem, or make a values-driven change.

### 3. Mechanism

Find the one or two concrete things that changed the trajectory. Strong mechanisms are observable:

- A realization that a field or role was accessible
- A relevant opportunity shared in a community
- A conversation that clarified next steps
- Feedback that improved an application or project
- A specific introduction, workshop, or resource

Avoid vague phrases such as “the experience was transformative.” State what happened instead.

### 4. Now-state

Record the current role, organization or team if approved, and what the person actually does. Translate technical jargon enough for the target audience to understand the work.

Use named outputs only when they add proof or interest. Do not pile up credentials. One meaningful project, publication, placement, product, or grant can do more work than a long resume list.

### 5. Timeline and compression

Map the sequence from joining or starting to the current result. Calculate a short, truthful timeframe when it sharpens the story, such as “within six months” or “the following year.” Do not force a compressed timeline if the facts do not support one.

### 6. Quotes

Pull three to five verbatim candidate quotes. Favor quotes that speak to the reader’s identity or uncertainty, not only the subject’s achievement.

Good quote categories are:

1. **Discovery:** “I did not know this path was open to someone like me.”
2. **Mechanism:** “I found the opportunity through the community.”
3. **Conviction:** “I would make the same choice again.”

Light trimming is allowed only when it preserves the exact meaning and grammar. Do not rewrite a quote into something the subject did not say.

## Generate three hook options

For feed-based platforms, the first two lines determine whether someone keeps reading. Write three distinct hooks before writing the full post. Keep each to two short sentences, usually under about 140 characters total where platform limits make that useful.

### Hook A: Discovery

Use when the audience shares the subject’s former blocker.

**Formula:** The subject did not know or believe a relevant possibility. Soon afterward, they reached a specific outcome through a surprising concrete mechanism.

This is often the best default because it makes the reader think, “That might be me.”

### Hook B: Identity collision

Use when the before-and-after contrast is vivid and easy to understand.

**Formula:** A short time ago, the subject was doing a specific thing. Today, they are doing a sharply different specific thing.

This works well for broader audiences who may not share the subject’s exact blocker.

### Hook C: Stakes-led

Use only when a meaningful cost or risk is approved and the audience will read it as honest conviction rather than a warning.

**Formula:** The subject accepted a specific cost to do something. Now they are taking a concrete action or doing meaningful work.

Do not use a sacrifice hook if it implies that participation requires hardship or if it distracts from a more accessible message.

Choose one recommended hook. Briefly explain why it fits the target audience, and state why the other two are less suitable.

## Draft the post

Aim for roughly 160 to 220 words unless the platform or audience calls for another length. Shorter is usually stronger.

Use this sequence:

1. **Hook:** Use the recommended hook.
2. **Before-state:** One short paragraph showing the subject’s previous situation and a relevant alternative path.
3. **Name the intervention:** State clearly that they joined the program, used the resource, or entered the community. Do not leave the mechanism implicit.
4. **Mechanism and outcome:** Explain the concrete turning points, then land the immediate result in plain language.
5. **Current work:** Describe what they do now and why it matters in understandable terms.
6. **Optional honest cost:** Include only if approved and genuinely useful.
7. **Optional pull quote:** Include only if it adds a distinct truth not already carried by the hook or body.
8. **CTA:** Address the reader directly and give one clear next action.

For external links on platforms that reduce reach for in-post links, place the link in a comment, profile page, or designated destination instead of the body. Make this a publishing choice, not an unverified universal rule.

## Style rules

Adapt to the chosen brand voice, but use these broadly useful defaults:

- Use short paragraphs and generous whitespace.
- Write direct declarative sentences.
- Prefer simple past tense when possible.
- Use concrete names, roles, dates, and figures only when verified and approved.
- Use the subject’s first name after the first full introduction if that fits the publication’s tone and consent.
- Prefer plain verbs over corporate language.
- Let evidence create admiration. Do not call the subject exceptional, inspiring, or brilliant without showing why.
- Use contractions if the voice is conversational.
- Keep the CTA in full second person: “If you are…” and “you can…”
- Avoid emojis unless they are an explicit brand choice.
- Do not use em dashes. Use periods, commas, or line breaks instead.

Remove common machine-like phrasing on the final pass. Cut empty transitions, dramatic setup frames, filler intensifiers, hedge words, abstract nouns that replace evidence, balanced “on one hand/on the other hand” constructions, and reflective summary sentences after the CTA.

Avoid words such as “leverage,” “unlock,” “harness,” “navigate,” “deep dive,” “journey,” “transformation,” and “paradigm” unless they are necessary in a direct quote.

Read the post aloud. If it sounds like a generic thought-leadership template, shorten it and replace abstractions with facts.

## Graphic quote options

Provide three options for a visual quote card. Each should be self-contained, under 15 words when possible, and taken verbatim from approved source material.

Offer one quote from each category:

- Discovery
- Mechanism
- Conviction

Recommend one. Discovery quotes are often strongest because they work without surrounding context and reflect the reader’s possible uncertainty. Choose a mechanism or conviction quote instead only if it is clearer, more memorable, and understandable on its own.

## Readiness audit

Before sending the draft for review, check:

- Is every name, role, date, figure, and title verified?
- Are transcript-derived details cross-checked where needed?
- Does the post show a concrete mechanism, not just a result?
- Does it avoid overstating causation?
- Is the intervention named clearly?
- Does the opening mirror a real audience concern?
- Is the current work understandable to a non-specialist reader?
- Have sensitive claims and direct quotes been flagged for approval?
- Is the CTA clear and directed at the intended reader?
- Are there no em dashes, unsupported superlatives, corporate phrases, or generic filler?

## Delivery format

Create the draft in the user’s chosen document system if one is available. Use a clear title format such as:

`YYYY-MM-DD: Case study post, [Subject first name]`

In the accompanying message, provide only:

- The recommended hook and the two alternatives
- The three graphic quote options and recommendation
- A list of approval items
- A list of missing information that would strengthen the post
- The document location or link, if applicable

Do not treat the first draft as final. If feedback says “make the hook better,” generate new hooks rather than making tiny edits. If asked to make it shorter, cut secondary biography first while preserving the mechanism and outcome. If a subject rejects a sensitive line, replace it with the approved fallback without weakening the whole story.

After the final version is accepted, review the feedback for reusable lessons. Update the workflow only when a recurring pattern is clear, such as a missing intake question, a consistent voice preference, or a repeated verification issue. Do not invent process changes from a clean review cycle.

name: create-editorial-cover-images
description: Create cover images from an article through five distinct concepts, visual review, and three informed improvements using the chosen image generator.
---

# Create editorial cover images

Turn an article into eight finished cover-image options. Develop five distinct concepts, generate and inspect every result, then create three improvements based on what actually worked. The user chooses from finished images with a clear connection to the article.

Use the user's chosen image generator and publishing format. No particular medium, palette, account, or service is assumed. If the user explicitly requests prompts only, follow the prompt-only branch instead of generating images.

## Establish the brief

Read the complete article before developing concepts. A title alone is rarely enough to distinguish an image that belongs to this piece from a generic illustration of its topic. If the copy is missing, ask for it before generating.

Identify the article's central move: the idea or change in perspective the reader should take away. Notice its emotional progression, including where it becomes quieter, turns, or reaches its conclusion. Extract concrete images, actions, and metaphors already present in the writing. Note the tone, such as reflective, urgent, hopeful, sober, or celebratory, because it constrains the image's mood. Use this analysis to shape the work; do not begin with a lengthy summary unless requested.

Reuse preferences already supplied. Ask only for missing choices that materially change the output, keeping related questions together:

- **Mood:** Offer interpretations grounded in specific parts of this article. Explain which part each mood emphasizes, so the choice concerns the story rather than abstract adjectives.
- **Subject:** Explore a human figure, a landscape, a single symbolic object, or an abstract composition as appropriate. Respect explicit restrictions on people, settings, or representations.
- **Palette:** Offer a few palettes suited to the proposed moods. Describe their lightness, contrast, and character as well as naming colors, so choices do not depend on color labels alone.
- **Orientation:** Establish the intended placement and crop. A wide header, square preview, and portrait cover need different compositions. Use dimensions supplied by the user or verified for the destination; do not assume one publication's ratio suits another.

Also establish the medium or style, such as photography, drawing, painting, or collage, if the request leaves it open. The article and intended audience should guide the options. Do not turn one person's aesthetic into a universal default. Confirm the generator if it is not already clear. Collect outstanding answers before treating a partial reply as the full brief.

Keep a short working brief containing the agreed mood, subject restrictions, palette, medium, format, and generator. Carry it through both rounds without asking the same preference questions again.

## Propose five distinct concepts

Present exactly five ideas in a numbered list. Give each a short title, a one- to three-sentence description of what the viewer sees, and a brief explanation of the article's idea or emotional beat it expresses.

Vary subjects, compositions, and interpretations. Five changes to one scene do not provide a meaningful range. Unless subject restrictions rule them out, include at least one landscape-only option and one single-object or symbolic option. Check that each concept has a specific reason to belong to this article. Replace any concept whose explanation could accompany almost any article about the same topic.

Give a one-line initial recommendation, then generate all five without asking the user to choose first. The first round provides visible alternatives for comparison. Do not stop at concepts or written prompts when finished images were requested.

## Write useful visual prompts

Write one self-contained prompt per concept. Keep the visual direction specific enough to render while avoiding competing instructions. Use this structure, combining sections where that reduces repetition:

```
Create one image: [medium, format, and overall visual character].

Subject: [what is visible, its action, prominence, and position; place relevant exclusions alongside the description].

Setting: [surroundings, depth, and foreground or background relationships where useful].

Light and palette: [direction and quality of light, specific colors, contrast, and transitions].

Technique: [visible properties of the chosen medium, edge treatment, texture, detail level, and negative space].

Mood: [the intended feeling and its connection to the article's central idea].

Composition: [focal point, where the eye enters, placement of major shapes, requested dimensions or aspect ratio, and crop considerations].

Avoid: [only the artifacts, visual conventions, or content that conflict with this brief].
```

Name colors and their relationships instead of relying only on words such as warm or moody. For example, a pale ochre field against dark violet shadows describes a more concrete visual decision than dramatic lighting. Use examples to clarify the selected palette, not to impose a fixed palette on every article.

Explain the physical appearance of the chosen medium. A charcoal drawing might depend on broad tonal masses, broken edges, and visible paper; a photograph might depend on depth of field and the direction of natural light. Avoid incompatible technique instructions simply because they appeared in an earlier prompt.

Place exclusions beside the relevant positive instruction as well as in a final list when useful. If an anonymous figure matters, describe how anonymity is achieved. If the design requires empty space for later typography, specify where it belongs. Establish whether lettering is part of the brief, and avoid unintended text, logos, borders, or watermark-like artifacts.

Send the generator only the visual brief needed for the image. Do not paste the full unpublished article or unrelated personal details by default. Use article-specific facts only when supported by the copy and appropriate for the user's intended publication. A visual metaphor should not invent an event or imply a factual depiction the source does not support.

## Generate the first five

Use the chosen generator's supported workflow. Adapt the prompt format to its actual capabilities, and explicitly request an image so a text response is not mistaken for the deliverable. Respect existing access, spending, and approval boundaries. If the chosen service is unavailable, report the limitation and attempt safe recovery; agree on any replacement before sending content elsewhere.

Keep a working record of each option's number, title, concept, submitted prompt, generation status, output location, and review notes. Preserve the complete prompt so a truncated or failed submission can be repaired accurately. Start independent jobs concurrently only when the tool supports that safely and within its limits.

Confirm that every submission was accepted with the intended brief. Then confirm the actual image completed and can be opened at a useful size. An accepted request, elapsed time, placeholder, progress indicator, or text description does not establish completion. If an error appears, check whether an image already exists before retrying to avoid unnecessary duplicate work. Keep failed attempts separate from finished options.

## Inspect all five before improving

View every completed image at a useful size and evaluate the actual pixels. Do not evaluate only the generator's description or what you hoped the prompt would produce. Also inspect a small preview, because a cover must communicate when reduced or cropped.

For each image, record:

- Whether it communicates the article's central idea and emotional tone.
- Whether the subject and action read immediately, with a clear focal point.
- Whether the requested style, palette, orientation, and composition survived generation.
- Whether it feels too busy, generic, sentimental, static, or literal.
- Any visible anatomy, object, perspective, construction, or lettering artifacts.

Only after reviewing all five, design three new prompts. Tie each improvement to a visible observation: a strength to retain, a weakness to correct, and the change likely to help. Do not prewrite this round before seeing the first outputs.

A useful spread is one refinement of the strongest image, one combination of strengths from different images, and one new concept addressing a gap. Use judgment when a different spread would serve the article better. Each new image should contribute a meaningful alternative rather than another copy of an existing result.

Fix the cause of a weak result. If a composition is cluttered, reduce the number of objects or competing focal points before adding more instructions. If an image looks like a photograph with a painting filter, describe larger shapes, selective edges, and the medium's actual marks. If the scene resembles generic travel or office imagery, reconsider its action or metaphor instead of adding decoration.

Give a short progress update explaining what the first images revealed and what the next three will improve. Continue without requesting another selection or repeating the creative brief.

## Generate, review, and deliver options six through eight

Generate three new images from the revised prompts. Keep the first five intact so the user can compare originals with improvements. Inspect each new result using the same visual criteria and completion checks. Repair failed generation attempts where possible without counting them as finished options or substituting an old image.

Before delivery, verify that there are eight distinct, completed outputs that you personally inspected. Check that each can be opened from the final handoff and that titles and numbering match the working record. Use accessible files or verified output links supported by the chosen generator. Preserve the finished outputs for the user to compare.

Recommend the strongest rendered image in a short sentence explaining why it fits the article. Follow with a numbered list of all eight titles and their outputs, clearly identifying the final three as the second round. Keep the outputs as the final deliverable block. Avoid turning the handoff into a long design report.

If access, rate limits, or repeated generation errors prevent completion, state exactly which options are finished and which remain blocked. Preserve useful work for resuming. Do not claim eight images exist when some are only prompts or unsuccessful attempts.

After completion or selection, learn from explicit user feedback and observed results. When authorized to remember or update the workflow, save reusable lessons about interpreting articles, composition, prompt constraints, or verified generator conventions. Distinguish the user's stated preferences from your own aesthetic judgments. Do not turn one article's subject or a single successful image into a permanent default. Keep private article content out of reusable lessons, and make no update when nothing durable was learned. Report any saved lesson before the final deliverable block.

## Prompt-only branch

When the user explicitly wants prompts only, read the article and reuse or collect the same creative preferences. Propose five concepts, then wait for a selection unless the request already specifies concepts or asks for all prompts. Write each selected prompt in a separate fenced code block. If combining concepts, explain the combination in one line before the prompt.

Do not generate images in this branch. Do not describe hypothetical second-round prompts as improvements informed by visual review. Put the selected prompts last, with nothing after the final block.

## Adapt to another generator

When the user requests a version for another generator, preserve the concept, mood, composition, palette, and format. Change the prompt's structure or parameters only as needed by the target tool. A prose-oriented generator may suit a compact paragraph; another may accept short descriptive phrases and separate controls.

Check the target tool's supported conventions before specifying parameter flags or version identifiers. If the version matters and remains unclear, ask once rather than guessing. Keep each platform variant separate and clearly labeled. Changing generators should not quietly change the underlying creative idea.

name: plan-your-day
description: Choose one most important outcome, protect time for it, and make a realistic plan around existing commitments.
---

# Plan your day

Use this when the user wants to choose priorities, schedule work, or recover a
day that has become reactive.

## 1. Read the real day

Check the calendar, current tasks, deadlines, unfinished commitments, energy,
and any personal constraint the user chooses to share. Use the user's local
date and time. Do not propose work inside existing commitments.

## 2. Choose one most important outcome

Ask what result would make the day count. Turn it into a binary finish line,
such as sending a draft or making a decision. Avoid labels such as “work on” or
“make progress.”

Test the choice:

- Is it important rather than merely urgent?
- Can the user influence the result today?
- Does it fit the available focused time?
- Is another task more likely to be productive-looking avoidance?

## 3. Protect a focused block

Find the best uninterrupted window and match the task to the user's likely
energy. Break long work into realistic chunks with short breaks. Include setup
and a clear first action so the block begins without another decision.

## 4. Fit the rest around it

Choose a small number of secondary tasks. Batch shallow work. Remove or defer
anything that makes the plan implausible. Leave space for meals, movement,
travel, recovery, and unexpected work.

## 5. Pre-mortem

Ask what displacement work is most likely to steal the focused block. Name one
specific counter, such as closing messages, preparing the source document, or
starting before a meeting-heavy period.

## 6. Record the plan

Write the outcome, focused block, secondary tasks, and main risk into the user's
chosen planning system. Confirm that the plan fits the calendar before creating
or moving events.


---
name: review-your-day
description: Run a short end-of-day reflection on what happened, what mattered, and what should change tomorrow.
---

# Review your day

Use this at the end of the day before planning tomorrow.

## 1. Reconstruct the day

Read the plan, calendar, completed work, and any notes the user has chosen to
record. Ask what actually happened rather than assuming that calendar blocks
were completed.

## 2. Reflect briefly

Ask one question at a time:

1. What shipped compared with the plan?
2. What was the main win?
3. What drained energy or created friction?
4. What needs to be carried, delegated, or dropped?

If the most important outcome did not ship, ask what felt productive but did
not move it. Name the pattern without moralizing.

## 3. Extract learning

Distinguish a one-off disruption from a repeated problem. Look for a change to
the environment, task definition, timing, or commitment level that could make
tomorrow easier.

## 4. Record accurately

Write a concise journal entry in the user's chosen system. Preserve the user's
words and do not invent an emotional interpretation. If the system uses a
rating, ask the user rather than inferring it.

## 5. Close

End with the one fact tomorrow's plan should account for. Do not turn the review
into a full planning session unless the user asks to continue.


---
name: plan-your-week
description: Review the previous week, choose a few outcomes, cut lower-value work, and protect time for what matters.
---

# Plan your week

Use this to review the last week and commit to the next one.

## 1. Gather the week

Read the previous plan, current goals, calendar, overdue tasks, important
messages, and any personal commitments the user includes. Check that sources are
current before relying on them.

## 2. Review the previous week

Ask what shipped, what rolled over, and what the week taught the user about
capacity. Treat unfinished goals separately:

- Roll over when the goal still matters and has a credible path.
- Demote when it matters but does not deserve a weekly commitment.
- Drop when keeping it active creates noise without action.

## 3. Choose a few outcomes

Select one to three results that can be judged at the end of the week. If the
calendar is dominated by meetings, logistics, or care for other people, plan a
week that reflects that reality rather than pretending it is a writing retreat.

## 4. Cut work

Identify meetings, tasks, and projects that do not serve the chosen outcomes.
For long-deferred tasks, consider moving them out of the active backlog rather
than assigning another false deadline.

## 5. Pre-mortem

Ask what will most likely displace each outcome. Add one prevention or recovery
step. State what the user is deliberately deprioritizing.

## 6. Break down and schedule

Turn each outcome into clear tasks. Propose focused blocks around fixed
commitments, then recheck the live calendar before writing events. Do not create
tasks whose shape depends on an unresolved decision.

## 7. Record the commitment

Write the outcomes, rollover decisions, protected blocks, risks, and cuts into
the user's planning system. Keep the final plan short enough to guide the week.

# Review and plan a month

Use this workflow at a month boundary to review a completed or nearly completed month and create an executable plan for the next one. A full session normally takes 45–75 minutes: gather and show evidence first, reflect briefly, then make decisions and secure approval.

Review and planning belong together. The structural cause of a missed outcome, energy drain, or delivery problem should become part of the next month’s structure, rather than a vague lesson recorded separately.

## Purpose

Produce five things:

- An evidence-based account of the review month.
- A direct assessment of progress on active long-range goals and any personal commitment the user has chosen to track.
- A compact view of selected work, energy, focus, recovery, training, or delivery signals.
- A written **Review** for the ending month.
- A written **Plan** for the coming month, with a memorable theme, at most three outcomes, explicit cuts, capacity evidence, and a pre-mortem.

Gather and retain only information that serves these outputs.

## When to run

Run when the user asks for a monthly review, requests help planning a named month, or wants to close one month and begin another.

Use these defaults unless the user specifies a range:

- During the first few days of a month, review the prior calendar month and plan the current month.
- Later in a month, review the month to date and plan the next month. Label the review as partial and state the remaining days.
- If the user asks only for a forward plan, review first because the evidence should shape the plan. The user may explicitly skip the review.

State both ranges before reading anything:

> Reviewing **March 2026** (01 Mar–31 Mar). Planning **April 2026**.

Ask whether the user wants calendar-month boundaries or a practical range that includes an overlapping week. Record the actual planning range in the plan.

## Operating rules

1. **Read first; discuss second.** Show the factual picture before asking reflective questions.
2. **Batch independent reads.** Gather authorized sources in one initial pass where possible. Do not repeatedly interrupt the discussion for small lookups.
3. **Use live commitments.** Compare performance with the target, schedule, scope, or responsibility the user currently endorses—not an obsolete record.
4. **Check data quality before a strong verdict.** Missing syncs, delayed updates, incomplete logs, and inconsistent sources can distort results. Confirm surprising evidence with the user.
5. **Respect privacy and access boundaries.** Access calendars, journals, health information, task systems, and communications only for a legitimate planning purpose and with clear authorization. Use the minimum relevant date range and fields. Summarize sensitive material; do not expose unrelated details or raw private content.
6. **The user decides.** The assistant calculates, summarizes, asks hard questions, and holds constraints. The user selects priorities, trade-offs, and commitments.
7. **One decision at a time.** Do not advance past a planning move until the user has given a real answer.
8. **Stay at month altitude.** Define outcomes, milestones, capacity, structure, and commitments. Leave detailed daily or weekly task blocks to a separate execution workflow.
9. **Do not save an unapproved plan.** Notes, brainstorms, imports, and voice recordings are candidate inputs, not decisions. The user must restate or materially confirm the plan and explicitly approve it.
10. **Use explicit dates.** Prefer **DD MMM** unless the user requests another unambiguous format.
11. **Do not lecture.** For health, training, recovery, or personal practice, provide the evidence, direct conclusion, and agreed commitment. Provide specialist advice only when asked and appropriate.

## Step 1: Set the range and gather evidence

Determine the review month, comparison month, and planning month. Then make one initial batch of authorized reads.

Use the user’s chosen systems: project tracker, task manager, calendar, goals database, spreadsheet, notes, training log, health tracker, or facts supplied directly by the user. If no sources are available, ask for a short factual inventory. Never imply that unavailable records were checked.

| Evidence area | Initial evidence to gather |
|---|---|
| Prior monthly record | Prior theme, promised outcomes, commitments, and review findings. |
| Weekly records | Plans and reviews in the range, repeated blockers, milestones, and carried work. |
| Goals | Active weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual goals, with status and deadlines. |
| Work delivered | Completed tasks, decisions, projects, or deliverables, grouped into useful domains. |
| Calendar | Fixed deadlines, travel or leave, major events, recurring commitments, and meeting-heavy weeks. |
| Daily signals | User-selected ratings, focus time, habits, or brief note themes. |
| Recovery data | Optional sleep duration, sleep quality, and same-source recovery trends. |
| Training or practice | Optional sessions for the review and comparison months, plus the current commitment. |

For large sources, retrieve computed statistics and a small number of relevant themes rather than raw entries. Long journals, detailed calendars, and task lists can consume attention without improving the plan.

If a delegated helper is available, give it a narrow, authorized brief: analyze only the requested range and return a concise summary, not raw private material. A calendar summary should cover fixed multi-day commitments, approximate load by week, important recurring events, protected commitments the user wants included, and anomalies such as events scheduled during unavailable periods.

Before finalizing monthly outcomes, check any weekly plan overlapping the beginning of the new month. Reference and reconcile that plan; do not duplicate, overwrite, or contradict it.

## Step 2: Show the evidence picture

Present a compact, factual picture before inviting interpretation. Use numbers where useful and omit noise.

### Personal commitment verdict

Include this section when the user has chosen an active training, health, practice, or habit commitment. Compare actual behavior with the live target.

Depending on the domain, calculate:

- Total volume, sessions, repetitions, or practice instances.
- Average weekly volume and active days.
- Completion of key sessions or milestones.
- Longest gap in participation.
- Relevant balance measures, such as routine versus demanding sessions.
- Useful performance or recovery signals.
- Change from the comparison month.

Use this verdict taxonomy where it fits:

- **ON TRACK:** Key measures meet at least 90% of target and consistency is intact.
- **BEHIND:** A key measure is roughly 60–90% of target, or consistency materially broke.
- **OFF TRACK:** A key measure is below 60% of target, or there was a prolonged gap.
- **AT RISK:** A safety, injury, burnout, or sustained-decline signal makes the current approach unsafe or unlikely to succeed.

Adjust these thresholds only when the domain requires it, and state the adjustment. If records may be incomplete, ask: “The record shows this. Does that match reality?” before delivering a harsh verdict.

State one biggest corrective action for the next month. It must be concrete, but it is not yet the full plan.

### Goals and delivery

Summarize weekly commitments as completed, missed, deferred, or rolled forward. For each active long-range goal, state whether it **advanced**, **stalled**, or **regressed**, with one brief reason. Explicitly name goals that received no meaningful attention.

Summarize delivered work in a few meaningful domains. Avoid a long activity list; the question is whether effort produced intended progress.

### Life signals

Include only measures the user wants to track. Useful measures include rating distribution and average, focus hours, low-focus days, sleep duration, sleep quality, recovery trends from the same source, and repeated themes in notes.

Flag meaningful patterns: persistently low sleep, repeated short nights, several consecutive low-rating days, extended low-focus periods, or a mismatch between favorable averages and repeated written signs of strain. Numerical averages are not complete truth. Raise such a mismatch briefly without exposing unnecessary private detail.

## Step 3: Reflect on the month

Open with one specific observation from the evidence. Ask one question at a time and pursue no more than two or three threads unless the user asks for more depth.

Cover these before closing the review:

1. What genuinely shipped and feels like a win?
2. What cost more time or energy than it returned?
3. Was the main miss structural, circumstantial, or a genuine priority change?
4. What one behavior, boundary, or pattern must change next month?
5. If a personal commitment is in scope, what is the specific next-month commitment?

Useful prompts:

- “This outcome slipped across several weeks. What made it structurally difficult?”
- “The ratings were stable, but the notes suggest strain. What was happening?”
- “This goal progressed while others did not. What conditions made that possible?”

For a time-constrained user, complete the minimum viable review: the in-scope commitment verdict, material wellbeing flags, one structural fix, and one concrete next-month commitment.

## Step 4: Build the new-month plan

A plan is not a description of events plus optimistic targets. A real plan contains a defined outcome, current-state evidence, a path, capacity proof, trade-offs, forcing functions, a pre-mortem, and explicit approval.

### Move 1: Define outcomes

For every candidate priority, ask:

> What specifically is true by the final day of this planning range?

Make the answer measurable or plainly verifiable. Limit the plan to three outcomes; one or two is often better. Each should connect to a long-range goal or an explicitly chosen responsibility.

### Move 2: Establish current state

Size the gap using evidence, not mood. Check the relevant baseline: draft status, project milestone, task backlog, pipeline count, delivery metric, or other domain-specific measure. If the gap cannot be described, gather the missing evidence before creating the path.

### Move 3: Work backward

For each outcome, identify three to six moves by reasoning backward from the due date. Every move needs a date or window, an owner, and completion evidence.

Ask:

> For this to be true by the end date, what must be true halfway through? What needs to happen first?

### Move 4: Check capacity

Estimate usable focused capacity honestly:

> available working days × recently observed focused hours per day

Account for fixed commitments, travel, leave, and meeting-heavy periods. Compare supply with the effort implied by the paths. If demand exceeds supply, cut scope, defer work, reduce the outcome, or add genuine support now.

### Move 5: Name the cuts

Ask:

> What will explicitly not happen this month so these outcomes can?

The user names the cuts. A plan without a real not-doing list is a wish.

### Move 6: Add forcing functions and structure

Every fragile outcome needs an external forcing function: a stakeholder expecting a result by a date, a booked review, a committed event, or a downstream person waiting for the work.

Protect work vulnerable to interruption. Batch interruption-tolerant work around meetings and reserve the best available time for work requiring sustained attention. If a calendar conflict undermines the structure, add resolving it as an immediate action.

### Move 7: Run a pre-mortem

Ask:

> It is the final day of the month and this plan failed. What happened?

The user answers first. Record the two or three most likely failure modes and a concrete counter for each.

### Move 8: Obtain sign-off

Read the plan back in ten lines or fewer. The user must be able to state the theme and main outcomes from memory, then explicitly approve it.

Ask:

> Is this the plan?

If approval is vague, revise. Do not save yet.

## Required plan structure

```markdown
## THEME: [MEMORABLE, ACTION-ORIENTED LINE]

**Planning range:** [DD MMM–DD MMM].

## Shape of the month
[Fixed commitments, heavy periods, effective working weeks, and immediate constraints after month-end.]

## Outcomes
1. **[Outcome]** — Done by [DD MMM] when [binary test of done].
   - Current state: [honest gap].
   - Path: [dated milestones, owners, and completion evidence].
   - Forcing function: [external commitment].

## Capacity check
[Available capacity] versus [committed demand]; [scope decision].

## NOT doing
- [Explicit cut or deferral.]

## Structure
[The behavior, boundary, or environment change that counters the reviewed drain; include tracked delegated work and owners.]

## Personal commitment
[Specific measurable commitment, if in scope.]

## Pre-mortem
- Failure mode: [likely cause]. Counter: [specific response.]
```

## Step 5: Save the review and plan

After explicit approval, write two records in the user’s chosen system:

1. A **Review** attached to the ending month.
2. A **Plan** attached to the new month.

Create a missing monthly record if the system supports it. Use one final write operation where possible. If a plan already exists, show the relevant content and resolve the difference before overwriting it.

Use this review template:

```markdown
## Personal commitment verdict
**[ON TRACK / BEHIND / OFF TRACK / AT RISK / NOT IN SCOPE]**

- Actual: [key measures].
- Target: [current agreed target].
- Consistency: [relevant pattern or gap].
- Change from prior month: [key delta].
- Verdict: [one direct sentence].
- **Next-month commitment:** [specific commitment].

## Goals and delivery
- Weekly commitments: [completed]/[total] ([percent]%).
- Long-range goal movement: [goal and status].
- Work delivered: [concise grouped summary].

## Life signals
- Ratings: [chosen measures].
- Focus: [chosen measures].
- Sleep or recovery: [chosen measures].
- Flags: [none or named patterns].

## Win
[One meaningful result.]

## Drain
[One thing that cost more than it returned.]

## Structural fix for next month
[One named behavior, boundary, or system change.]
```

Confirm the save in one line and stop.

## Step 6: Improve the workflow

Record one precise, reusable improvement in the user’s chosen workflow document or improvement log. If no location exists, present it as a short durable rule for the user to save.

Look for a noisy read, false data assumption, misleading metric, corrected question, or repeatable planning pattern. Prefer one specific edit over a vague reminder. Do not store sensitive personal details as reusable workflow knowledge.

## Audit checks

Before finishing, verify:

- Review and planning ranges are explicit.
- Evidence was shown before reflective prompts.
- Reads used only authorized, relevant sources and minimized sensitive detail.
- Strong verdicts accounted for known data-quality limits.
- The plan has a named theme and no more than three outcomes.
- Each outcome has a test of done, date, path, owner, and forcing function.
- Capacity fits demand, or an explicit scope decision was made.
- The not-doing list contains genuine cuts.
- The structural fix responds to a reviewed drain.
- Overlapping weekly plans were reconciled.
- Any in-scope personal commitment is specific.
- The pre-mortem contains counters.
- The user explicitly approved the plan before it was saved.

## Common failure modes

- Starting with reflective prompts instead of evidence.
- Measuring against stale targets or old scope.
- Treating incomplete tracking as proof of failure.
- Mistaking a list of events for a plan.
- Overloading capacity while refusing to cut scope.
- Letting the assistant choose the user’s priorities.
- Saving an unapproved draft.
- Duplicating or conflicting with an overlapping weekly plan.
- Treating averages as more truthful than repeated evidence of strain.
- Applying generic productivity advice rather than fixing the actual drain.
- Overwriting an existing plan without resolving the conflict.
- Treating brainstorms, imports, or notes as confirmed commitments.
- Collecting or retaining private material that does not serve the review and plan.

name: get-unstuck
description: Work out why you are stuck, then use a short intervention suited to tiredness, dread, confusion, or distraction.
---

# Get unstuck

Use this when the user says they are tired, avoiding work, distracted, dreading
a task, or unable to begin.

## 1. Diagnose before coaching

Ask one short question at a time. Distinguish among:

- **Physical:** tired, hungry, uncomfortable, or overstimulated.
- **Dread:** the task carries conflict, judgment, or emotional cost.
- **Unclear:** the next action or standard is vague.
- **Distracted:** the environment keeps offering easier rewards.

More than one can be true. Do not treat an exhausted person as if they only need
discipline.

## 2. Choose a short intervention

Match the response to the diagnosis:

- Physical: food, water, movement, rest, or a smaller task.
- Dread: name the feared outcome and reduce the social or emotional exposure.
- Unclear: define the next visible action and a deliberately rough first pass.
- Distracted: change the environment and remove the competing cue.

Keep the intervention short. The aim is to begin useful motion, not hold a long
coaching conversation.

## 3. Start together

Ask the user to take one action that lasts only a few minutes. When useful,
write the opening line, checklist, or tiny plan with them. Confirm what “started”
means.

## 4. Learn from the result

After the attempt, ask what helped. Record patterns only with the user's
permission. Adapt future interventions to observed results rather than assuming
one motivational style always works.

name: wind-down-for-sleep
description: A quiet, interactive evening workflow that reduces stimulation, secures distractions, prepares essential morning needs offline, and provides a brief stimulus-control response when sleep does not come.
---

# Wind down for sleep

Use this workflow as the final part of an evening routine. Its purpose is not to review the day, solve problems, or build tomorrow’s plan. Its purpose is to make the transition from awake-day to sleep predictable: reduce stimulation, remove common distractions, complete a few practical tasks, and go to bed.

Use the full ritual when the user says they are winding down, ready for bed, or wants help settling for sleep. If the user says they cannot sleep, are still awake, or are frustrated in bed after trying to sleep, use only the **Can’t-sleep fallback**. Do not restart the full ritual.

A separate daily-review practice and next-day planning practice should happen earlier in the evening. This workflow assumes those practices exist but does not require a particular app, database, calendar, or device.

## Purpose and design rules

Every step should serve at least one of these functions:

1. **Reduce stimulation.** Lower bright light, screen use, active conversation, and problem-solving.
2. **Increase reliability.** Make it harder to drift into scrolling, work, or new decisions.
3. **Prepare the body and morning.** Complete small practical actions that reduce avoidable friction after waking.

Consistency matters more than complexity. Use a similar sequence on most nights. Keep the active ritual short enough that it does not become another task to avoid.

## Interaction rules

- Be quiet, direct, and low-stimulation. Use short prompts with no coaching language, jokes, emojis, or sleep-science lecture.
- Give one small group of actions at a time. Do not turn the ritual into a long conversation.
- For checklists, use plain bullet lists rather than interactive checkboxes. End each list with: **Reply “done” when all set.**
- Do not ask the user about tomorrow after the wind-down has started. Do not ask for priorities, intentions, goals, wins, or backup to-do lists.
- Do not reopen journaling, reflection, planning, messages, task systems, or calendars during the ritual.
- If the user raises a work problem, worry, or task, do not solve it. Say: **“Put a brief note somewhere safe for tomorrow. Do not work on it tonight.”**
- If the user is clearly exhausted, let them skip optional preparation steps. Do not skip the environment and distraction-control gate unless a safety, health, accessibility, or caregiving need makes it unsuitable.
- After the final close message, stop. Do not summarize what was completed, offer more help, create a follow-up prompt, or simulate another turn.

## Readiness check

Before beginning, establish only what is needed. Do not inspect messages, news, social feeds, task lists, or other attention-grabbing sources.

1. Check whether the user already completed their normal day review, if that information is available from the current session or a user-approved system.
2. If the review was missed, decide whether there is still enough room in the evening for the user’s normal brief review without delaying sleep.
3. Optionally check the next morning’s first fixed commitment, but only if the user has authorized calendar access and it is needed to choose practical access to a locked device.
4. Treat next-day planning status as silent information. If planning was missed, do not mention it, offer planning, or ask a substitute planning question.

If the day review was completed, say:

> Day closed. Starting wind-down.

If the review was missed but there is still enough room for it, offer it once:

> The day review was missed. Do you want to do the short review first?

If the user declines, or it is too late for a useful review, say:

> Leave the review for tomorrow. Start winding down now.

Then continue. If a review was skipped, any later bedtime note should go into a designated next-day capture location rather than creating a partial or empty journal record.

## Step 1: Environment and distraction gate

This is the load-bearing step. Do not continue until the user confirms it is complete.

Choose a simple set of cues that the user can repeat. A broadly useful default is:

> Before we start:
>
> - Change out of day clothes into sleep clothes.
> - Put on preferred low-light glasses, if used, or otherwise reduce bright light.
> - Turn off overhead lights; use dim, warm light only if needed.
> - Start quiet, familiar audio if it helps without demanding attention.
> - Put the phone in a charger outside reach or in a physical barrier that prevents casual checking.
> - Set the phone’s return or unlock point for the morning.
> - Keep any remaining device use limited to one necessary, low-stimulation device.
>
> Reply “done” when all set.

### Set device return access

Let the user choose a normal morning access point. If an early fixed commitment requires it, make access available earlier only when necessary for preparation, travel, communication, or safety. State the choice and reason briefly.

Example:

> Phone access returns before the first morning commitment so you can prepare and travel.

A physical barrier is often more reliable than a software restriction alone. The aim is not punishment. It is to prevent automatic late-night or early-morning scrolling.

If the user says they will change the lights or secure the phone later, respond once:

> Do it now. This is the highest-leverage step. I’ll wait.

Do not negotiate the rest of the routine while this gate remains incomplete.

## Step 2: Offline morning card

Offer a small physical morning card. Its role is to make the first part of the day independent from a phone, notifications, and memory.

Prompt:

> Write a small morning card. Keep it short enough to read at a glance. A useful template is:
>
> 1. Hygiene
> 2. Medication or supplements, if applicable
> 3. Water and breakfast
> 4. Movement, rehabilitation, or another health practice
> 5. Shower and get dressed
> 6. Leave for the day or begin the first planned block
>
> Add only a practical exception that matters tomorrow. Is anything different?

If the user names a change, tell them to write it in the appropriate place on the card. Do not make a digital card for them and do not turn this into planning.

Then ask:

> Card done?

This step is optional if the user is too tired or already has a dependable offline morning cue.

## Step 3: Physical preparation

Give a compact list tailored to the user’s normal needs. Group tasks by location to minimize movement and decisions. A default list is:

> - Fill water for the morning.
> - Brush teeth and complete essential nighttime hygiene.
> - Prepare a simple breakfast or place needed items together.
> - Put out required clothing, keys, mobility aids, or medication.
>
> Reply “done” when all set.

If a small missing item creates a worry, capture it in one designated location without solving it. For example: “Buy breakfast item.” Do not search for alternatives, open shopping tools, message someone, or start a planning conversation. Say only:

> Noted. Captured for later.

## Step 4: Brief settling practice

Offer one familiar, low-stimulation practice. Do not teach a new or complex exercise at bedtime.

Default prompt:

> Brief quiet meditation.

If meditation is not suitable, use an already accepted alternative such as gentle breathing, a short body scan, quiet stretching, or a few pages of a paper book outside bed. Avoid screen-based guided content and anything emotionally engaging or performance-focused.

Wait for a simple completion response.

## Step 5: Close

After the settling practice, send only:

> Close the device. Go straight to bed—no detour.
>
> See you tomorrow.

This is the final user-facing message. If the user says good night, remain silent or reply only: **Good night.**

## Can’t-sleep fallback

Use this only when the user reports being awake after attempting sleep.

Do not rerun the ritual. Do not reopen reflection, journaling, planning, device settings, or problem-solving. Respond briefly:

> Get out of bed. Keep the room dim and do a boring, screen-free activity until sleepy. Return to bed when sleepy. Do not check the time.

Suitable activities include reading on paper, folding laundry slowly, or another neutral task. Avoid work, emotionally engaging reading, exercise, food preparation, screens, and clock-checking. The goal is to keep the bed associated with sleep rather than wakeful frustration.

For recurring, severe, or safety-relevant sleep difficulty, encourage appropriate medical or sleep-care support.

## Routine audit and adaptation

Review the workflow after a run only if doing so will not re-engage the user at bedtime. Make changes based on observable friction, not novelty. Do not invent improvements after a clean run.

| Signal | Adaptation |
|---|---|
| The user repeatedly misunderstands a prompt | Rewrite it in plainer language or remove ambiguity. |
| A distraction barrier is routinely bypassed | Choose a stronger physical, account-level, or environmental barrier with the user. |
| A checklist item is consistently skipped and adds no value | Remove it or make it optional. |
| A practical issue repeatedly appears at bedtime | Move its prevention into an earlier review or planning practice. |
| A step makes the user more alert | Shorten it, simplify it, or move it earlier in the evening. |

Preserve what reliably works. The best wind-down is usually quiet, repeatable, and boring enough to become an automatic signal that the day is over.

name: plan-and-book-a-trip
description: Plan a trip around its purpose, compare complete journeys and current fares, and prepare or complete a booking within the user's authorization.

# Plan and book a trip

Understand the trip before optimizing its transport. Establish what the traveler wants, compare a small set of complete journeys, and carry the chosen option through preparation or authorized booking. Treat the user's current instructions as authoritative. Previous trips provide context, not permanent rules.

## 1. Understand the trip

Start with a focused discovery pass. For a continuing conversation, reuse the established brief and ask what changed. Follow a request to skip discovery or check one specific fare without forcing a new interview.

Read the supplied invitation, itinerary, article, event agenda, or other relevant material. With permission, consult calendars, travel correspondence, and existing reservations for this trip. Use only the minimum relevant sources and information for the legitimate planning purpose. Access to an account does not authorize unrelated searches or investigation of companions. Exclude unrelated or sensitive personal details, respect consent and privacy expectations, and keep findings within the approved private planning space. Do not contact anyone without authorization.

Look for the trip's purpose, venues, possible dates, companions, accommodation, existing bookings, and commitments immediately before and after travel. Distinguish an invitation from confirmed attendance, a provisional calendar entry from a hard deadline, and an old receipt from a current preference. Resolve conflicts where possible and label remaining uncertainty.

Retrieve accessible facts yourself. Ask the traveler about intentions and trade-offs, rather than asking them to copy information already available in an authorized source. Keep the initial research short enough for the traveler to shape the trip before detailed shopping begins.

### Ask questions that shape the journey

Briefly state what is known, then ask a compact group of relevant questions. Four to six often works for an open-ended trip; use fewer when the answers are already clear.

- **Purpose:** What would make this trip worthwhile? Which events, visits, or activities matter most?
- **People and places:** Who is traveling or being visited? Which stops are essential, optional, or best visited in a particular order?
- **Time:** How long would the traveler like in each place? What fixes departure, arrival, and return? If dates are flexible, what range is useful?
- **Pace:** Is the trip for work, leisure, or both? Is recovery time or arriving rested important? Are quiet workdays or unstructured days needed?
- **Practical constraints:** What accommodation and local transport already exist? Are there accessibility, spending, or reimbursement constraints?
- **Scope:** Is the requested outcome research, booking preparation, or an authorized purchase?

Wait for answers to choices that materially affect the trip before searching tickets. Continue independent context gathering while waiting. Do not impose a numerical budget when the user wants to understand trade-offs first.

### Establish preferences and agree the brief

Ask only about preferences that remain unknown and matter to the options. These can include direct versus connecting services, cabin comfort, overnight sleeping needs, seats, luggage, rail class, loyalty benefits, and flexibility. Treat each as the traveler's choice. Do not assume an airline, seat, airport, or premium cabin is universally preferable.

Summarize the purpose, people, stops, time in each place, fixed dates, flexible ranges, work and recovery needs, accommodation, and unresolved points. Give the traveler an opportunity to correct the summary. Clear answers can establish agreement without a separate approval ceremony. Keep provisional dates visibly provisional.

## 2. Research current transport

Search useful dates and routes against the agreed brief. If available transport would substantially change the trip, return to the traveler with that choice.

Use current schedules and fares. Search aggregators can reveal routes and date differences, but verify the selected itinerary, operating carrier, fare family, and conditions with the provider when possible. A marketing carrier's name does not establish who operates the service.

If a tool or provider fails, attempt permitted safe recovery. Name the failed source, report the exact error, and explain which facts remain missing or unverified. Disclose any switch of source and the resulting verification limits. Do not imply a blocked checkout or inaccessible personal offer was checked.

Compare useful combinations: return tickets, arriving and departing through different cities, nearby airports, rail, and ground transfers. Consider accommodation, cross-city travel, and lost usable time when judging a cheaper fare. Explain any connection or airport change before treating it as acceptable.

Check transport to the actual destination. An airport arrival may leave a long onward journey. Verify the intended station when names are ambiguous. Check timetable-release limits, holiday disruption, and planned engineering work; do not invent a precise service or price before it is available.

Label each quote as a selected live itinerary, an indicative date-grid price, or an estimate. Record when it was checked, the currency, and what it includes. An advertised starting price is not proof that the required ticket can be bought. Use verified links for options and terms.

### Compare the actual product

Use the comfort levels relevant to the traveler. When comparing premium economy, verify that it is a distinct cabin rather than an extra-legroom economy seat. For overnight journeys where sleep matters, compare confirmed sleeping arrangements and verify the actual aircraft or train product. A service label alone does not guarantee a lie-flat seat or the expected facilities.

Inspect every segment of a mixed-cabin itinerary. A higher cabin on an overnight leg and a lower cabin on a daytime return may suit the trip better than upgrading everything. For rail, confirm the named class and fare conditions rather than trusting a reseller's generic class label.

Include required seat selection and luggage in the price. Check availability of the preferred seat, any selection fee, and whether assignment is confirmed. Verify the fare's cabin-bag allowance and size or weight restrictions. A personal-item allowance may not cover the traveler's bag. Included services have value only when the traveler needs them.

### Evaluate upgrades carefully

When upgrades are relevant, compare buying the desired cabin outright, changing a ticket by paying the fare difference, and purchasing a separate upgrade. Before booking, compare total costs; afterward, compare additional costs and conditions. Do not assume a previous upgrade payment carries forward to another change.

Separate confirmed seats from award or loyalty waitlists. An empty seat map is not proof that an upgrade can clear. If sleep or comfort is essential, recommend a confirmed acceptable option. Buy a lower cabin only if the traveler would be content flying it.

Verify fare-family eligibility, current loyalty benefits, waitlist rules, and any restrictions before buying a ticket as an upgrade strategy. Do not claim that a particular point before departure is reliably cheapest. Prices can rise, cabins can sell out, and preferred seats can disappear.

Compare cash with points and any copayment using a stated valuation assumption. Read the specific upgrade's change, cancellation, refund, and unsuccessful-waitlist terms. A flexible ticket does not necessarily make an upgrade refundable.

For an existing reservation, inspect personal upgrade offers and alternative ticket-change prices when authenticated access is available and authorized. Public fares do not establish a reservation-specific offer. If login or unavailable tools prevent a check, attempt permitted recovery, identify what remains unverified, and request only the user action needed to proceed. Continue independent comparisons.

## 3. Compare complete journeys

Give two or three useful options with a recommendation. If only one route meets the brief, explain that rather than inventing alternatives.

Show local departure and arrival dates and times, airport or station names, total journey duration, and overnight date changes. Include realistic buffers for immigration, luggage, station check-in, and travel between terminals or across a city. Verify the provider's current arrival guidance and allow practical contingency.

Distinguish protected connections from independently booked tickets. Explain who bears the risk if the first service is late. Consider a longer connection or overnight stay when appropriate, accounting for accommodation already available.

Use a compact comparison such as:

| Option | Dates and route | Cabin and fare | Complete cost | Main benefit | Main drawback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Option] | [Local dates, route, duration] | [Actual product on each segment] | [Currency, tickets, required extras and transfers] | [Time, comfort or flexibility gained] | [Restriction, effort or uncertainty] |

Explain what extra spending buys. List material change and refund restrictions, luggage, seat fees, and ground transport. Show different currencies separately or clearly label the conversion assumption. Do not add unlike currencies into one unexplained total.

## 4. Prepare and complete the booking

Lead with the recommended dates and route, the comparison, verified booking links, the quote-check time, unresolved facts, and the decision needed. Keep personal identity and reservation information out of a shareable summary unless required for its purpose.

Prepare a concrete, reviewable booking before requesting any necessary purchase approval. A request to compare travel does not authorize payment. If the user has already authorized the specific purchase or an adequate scope and price ceiling, continue within that authorization without repeatedly asking. A material mismatch needs resolution before checkout.

Verify the passenger name against the traveler's supplied identity details; never invent missing information. Check dates, airports or stations, operating provider, routing, class on each segment, fare family, seats, luggage, total price, and terms against the chosen option. Keep payment and identity documents within the authorized booking process.

After purchase, verify a provider confirmation. Report the booked journey and total, any unassigned seat, and remaining transport arrangements. A selected fare or partially completed checkout is not a booking. Keep references and receipts in a private trip record rather than the reusable skill.

## 5. Monitor and learn when requested

If the plan includes recurring fare or upgrade checks, establish a real schedule with an available authorized automation facility. Verify that it can access the reservation and report useful changes before describing monitoring as active. Track additional cost, cabin, seat availability, conditions, and check time. Notify the traveler when a decision is useful; monitoring does not authorize a purchase.

Stop monitoring after departure, a completed upgrade, or a changed plan. If scheduling or authentication is unavailable, state that monitoring is not running. Never promise ongoing checks without an execution mechanism.

During active use, apply corrections immediately. When authorized to remember preferences, save clear lasting choices with their qualifications and replace superseded defaults. Keep current fares, event dates, one-off exceptions, and tentative preferences in the trip record. Ask whether a choice applies to this trip or future trips only when that distinction is unclear.

Learn from verified outcomes and traveler feedback about comfort, connections, and booking friction. Successful checkout does not establish satisfaction. Preserve useful general lessons without accumulating incident histories, personal identifiers, or credentials. Learning creates no additional permission to purchase, message others, or access accounts.

name: prepare-for-a-meeting
description: Gather the relevant history, clarify the desired outcome, and produce a focused agenda and preparation brief.

# Prepare for a meeting

Use this before a consequential meeting or when the user asks for an agenda.

## 1. Read the meeting

Check the invitation, attendees, timing, stated purpose, and linked materials.
Read any supplied proposal, document, or deck in full before drafting an agenda.

## 2. Gather context

Search the sources most likely to contain the relationship history, prior
decisions, promises, open questions, and recent changes. A recent transcript or
meeting note often matters more than older summaries.

Distinguish facts, other people's views, and the user's current position. Do not
infer what the user wants to promise.

## 3. Ask focused questions

Before drafting, summarize what the evidence establishes and ask a small number
of questions about:

- The desired result.
- The user's current stance.
- Sensitive topics or boundaries.
- Decisions that can and cannot be made in the meeting.

## 4. Prepare the brief

Include:

- The meeting's job.
- Essential context.
- The user's desired outcome.
- A short agenda ordered by importance.
- Questions to ask.
- Likely objections or difficult moments.
- Decisions, owners, and follow-up to capture.

Keep the agenda realistic for the available time. Put the most important topic
before status updates and background.

description: Review authorized meeting records to identify genuine unfinished commitments, create clear deduplicated tasks for confident follow-ups, and batch only the questions that require user judgment.

# Capture meeting actions

Turn authorized meeting records into reliable post-meeting follow-up tasks. Use this workflow as a daily sweep, for a selected date range, or for a manually supplied set of meetings.

The goal is not to convert every discussion into work. Each meeting should result in zero tasks, one combined follow-up, or multiple separate tasks only when there is a genuine, unfinished commitment that should be tracked.

## Purpose and operating rules

Use only meeting records that the user is authorized to access for a legitimate work purpose. Review the minimum relevant sources, preserve appropriate access boundaries, and omit unrelated sensitive personal details from tasks and reports.

Before each run, apply these outcome rules:

- **0 tasks** when work was completed during the meeting, belongs to another owner, is already tracked, or the meeting was only for information gathering.
- **1 task** when related actions can be completed together for the same person or group on the same time horizon.
- **Multiple tasks** only when counterparties, outcomes, or timing differ materially.

Use this evidence order when sources conflict:

1. **Transcript or recording-derived text:** strongest evidence of who agreed to do what and when.
2. **Human-written notes:** useful supporting evidence, especially explicit action sections.
3. **Automated summary:** useful for orientation, but not authoritative for ownership.
4. **Pre-meeting agenda:** describes intended discussion, not a commitment.

Automated summaries often misattribute work, especially in recurring one-to-ones, brainstorming sessions, and meetings where attendees list their own to-dos. Never create a task solely because a summary labels it as an action item. Confirm the owner in the transcript or reliable notes.

Track unfinished outcomes, not conversation. Skip work that was completed live, delegated to another owner, already tracked elsewhere, or merely discussed. An idea, statement of interest, or open question is not a task unless someone accepted responsibility for a concrete outcome.

Apply documented responsibility and delegation boundaries supplied by the user or organization. Attendance at a meeting does not make the user accountable for all work in that area.

## 1. Select the meetings

Accept a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, a relative date such as “yesterday,” a date range, or a supplied meeting list. If no input is given, use this broadly useful default:

- Before a configurable early-morning cutoff in the user’s local time, process the previous day.
- Otherwise, process the current day.

State the selected scope once, for example: “Scanning meetings for 23 Apr.” Find meetings attended by the user and collect:

- Title, date, and time
- Meeting-record link or identifier
- Attendees, if available and necessary
- Transcript, notes, summary, and relevant linked context

Report a compact count before processing. Do not infer actions from a meeting title alone.

## 2. Fetch and inspect complete records

Fetch full meeting records in parallel where the selected meeting system supports batching. Do not search for existing tasks yet: first identify the people, topics, and candidate outcomes that make deduplication accurate.

For long transcripts, use a repeatable search, extraction, or chunking method rather than relying on truncated previews. Search for commitment language such as:

- “I’ll …”
- “Let me …”
- “I can …”
- “I’ll send …”
- “I’ll follow up …”
- “I’ll introduce …”
- A request followed by explicit acceptance

Review summary action items as candidates, then verify them against the transcript and surrounding conversation. A promise may have been conditional, reassigned, fulfilled live, or directed at another attendee.

## 3. Triage each meeting

Classify the meeting loosely. Classification provides a starting expectation, not a rule that overrides evidence.

| Meeting type | Usual outcome | Guidance |
|---|---:|---|
| External relationship meeting | 1 task, sometimes a later reconnect | Capture promised material, outreach, introductions, or explicitly timed follow-up. |
| Information-gathering, interview, or reference call | 0 tasks | Create work only for an explicit out-of-meeting commitment. |
| Internal planning or team meeting | 0–1 user-owned task | Capture the user’s deliverable, not the full team action list. |
| Coaching or recurring one-to-one | 0–1 task | Usually create a task only for explicit work outside the session. |
| Partnership, commercial, or decision meeting | 1–2 tasks | Often separate an internal decision from an external response. |

For every meeting, identify:

- Relationship context and why the meeting occurred.
- Candidate actions owned by the user.
- Work completed during the meeting.
- Work delegated to another named owner.
- Explicit future commitments and timing.
- Enough neutral context for a task to remain understandable weeks later.
- Source and related links.

Create no task when work was completed live, another person owns it, the meeting was purely informational and any needed synthesis is already recorded, the action is covered by an active task, or the statement was not a commitment.

## 4. Decide the task shape

Combine actions into one task when they have the same counterparty, time horizon, and outcome. For example, sending promised material, answering related questions, and offering meeting times can form one follow-up task.

Split tasks when:

- Timing differs substantially, such as an immediate reply and a reconnect months later.
- Different counterparties need separate communication.
- An internal decision and an external response are distinct outcomes.
- A combined task would have an unclear finish line.

This is a readiness gate: do not proceed to task creation until each proposed task has a clear owner, unfinished outcome, sensible shape, and enough context to stand alone.

## 5. Write the task

Use the user’s chosen task system and field names. At minimum, capture:

- **Title:** short, verb-led, and specific, such as “Follow up with prospective partner about pilot scope.”
- **Status:** the standard open status.
- **Due date:** based on an explicit commitment whenever possible.
- **Priority:** use the user’s scale; default to normal important work and reserve the highest level for a real deadline, material risk, or waiting counterparty.
- **Time estimate:** realistic minutes.
- **Notes:** context, action checklist, communication drafts, and links.

### Due-date rules

- Immediate promised follow-up: next working day unless another date was agreed.
- Scheduled reconnect: agreed date, or a reasonable reminder date before it.
- Weekly or sprint commitment: next relevant review or planning session.
- Flexible work: roughly one week, adjusted to workload.
- Older meetings processed late: move an immediate follow-up to the next workable date rather than assigning an already-passed date, unless the original deadline still applies.

Do not raise priority merely because capture happened late.

### Notes template

```markdown
[Two or three sentences of time-independent context. Include relevant absolute
dates, why this matters, the commitment, and any necessary sensitivity.]

## Actions
- [Concrete action]
- [Concrete action]

## Draft message

Subject: [Specific subject]

Hi [First name],

[Short, direct message that fulfills the commitment.]

Best,
[Sender]

## Links
- Meeting record: <link>
- Related document: <link>
```

Avoid unnecessary private discussion in a task system that may be broadly visible. Follow the user’s known writing preferences. Otherwise, draft concise, warm, professional messages with a clear request or promised deliverable. If the task is to send a message, write a ready-to-send draft rather than merely saying “email them.” For introductions, use double opt-in: seek permission from each relevant party before connecting them.

## 6. Deduplicate before creation

Run one batched search of active tasks before creating new ones. Search by meeting link or identifier, counterparty, distinctive topic terms, and proposed title.

Treat an active task as a duplicate when it covers the same outcome, not merely when its wording matches. Skip the new task, or update the existing task if the meeting adds a meaningful action, deadline, or context. Record the duplicate decision so it can be reported clearly.

## 7. Create confident tasks

Create high-confidence tasks in a batch when possible. If the environment supports opening created records, open them in the selected task system rather than filling the status update with management links.

For every skipped meeting, give a brief reason, such as “No out-of-meeting commitment,” “Completed during the call,” “Owned by another role,” or “Already covered by an active task.”

## 8. Batch uncertain questions

Skip this step entirely when all decisions are confident. Do not interrupt for each ambiguity. Create confident tasks first, then ask all remaining questions together.

Ask the smallest question that resolves ownership, scope, timing, completion status, delegation, or duplicate handling:

```markdown
**[Meeting title]**
Question: [One specific question]
Context: [One sentence grounded in the record]
Option A: [Task to create or update if true]
Option B: [Skip or alternate task shape]
```

Wait for answers before creating uncertain tasks. After answers arrive, create or update the remaining tasks and rerun any necessary duplicate check if the answer changed the task outcome.

## 9. Maintain reusable guidance

Before declaring the run complete, capture lessons that genuinely improve future runs. Keep this separate from the meeting task itself.

- Add a short example or note to a reusable meeting-archetype reference when a recurring pattern affects triage, such as a common attribution error, reliable sign of in-meeting completion, or an archetype exception.
- Update the core workflow only for cross-cutting principles, changed defaults, or a new required step.
- Record a new delegation boundary in the user’s or organization’s maintained responsibility reference when it applies beyond one meeting.

Do not turn one-off facts into permanent rules. Small additions to an examples or patterns reference can be made directly. Ask for confirmation before structural workflow changes, such as adding or removing steps or changing the evidence order. Briefly report any reusable guidance added or changed.

## 10. Audit and report

Before finishing, verify that:

- Every created task has a genuine owner and unfinished outcome.
- Transcript evidence supports ownership where summaries are unclear.
- Completed and delegated work was excluded.
- Active duplicates were not recreated.
- Titles are action-oriented and notes stand alone.
- Dates, priority, and estimates are plausible.
- Each task links to its source record.
- Message drafts are ready to send and follow the user’s preferences.
- Every uncertain item is either asked as a specific question or explicitly deferred.

Report the essential outcome only: meetings reviewed, tasks created or updated with due dates, skipped items with brief reasons, unresolved questions, and any reusable guidance changes. Keep status updates terse and factual.

name: turn-a-message-into-a-task
description: Read a message or conversation, identify the real commitment, research only what is needed, and prepare the work so the remaining human action is small and clear. Create a task record only when tracking adds value.

# Turn a message into a task

Use this workflow when one or more message links, copied conversations, or requests may require follow-up. The goal is not to log every to-do. The goal is to understand the request, complete safe preparatory work, and leave either a ready-to-finish deliverable or a task record with a clear next action.

Use only communications, documents, and records that you are authorized to access for a legitimate purpose. Read the minimum relevant material. Do not expose unrelated private information, sensitive personal details, or restricted records in the task, draft, or final report.

## Operating principle

A useful result reduces the user's remaining effort. A task with empty notes, an unclear owner, or no prepared next step is usually not useful. A strong result might include a researched answer, a draft reply, a decision brief with a recommendation, a prepared follow-up, or an outline of a required document.

Never send messages, email, invitations, approvals, or other external communications through this workflow. Draft or stage them only, subject to the user's authorization and the capabilities of their chosen communication and task systems.

## 1. Read the full conversation

Start from the linked or supplied message, but do not treat that message as the entire request.

1. Open the parent message and all available replies.
2. If the link points to a reply, use its parent as the conversation root.
3. If the linked message is top-level and has replies, read the thread before deciding what to do.
4. Note who is involved, what has been promised, deadlines, linked material, and explicit ownership.
5. Treat the linked message as the anchor, while treating later messages as potentially decisive context.
6. Check whether a later reply has answered the request, changed its scope, reassigned it, or completed it.

If the work is already complete, do not create a duplicate task. Briefly explain that the conversation appears resolved. Ask whether the user still wants a record only when there is genuine ambiguity or a clear administrative need.

### Conversation extraction checklist

Capture these facts in working notes:

- **Ask:** What is being requested, in plain language?
- **Requester and audience:** Who is waiting for an answer or deliverable?
- **Owner:** Who can actually take the next action?
- **Commitment:** What, if anything, was promised already?
- **Timing:** Is there a deadline, event date, dependency, or waiting period?
- **Status:** Is the work open, blocked, superseded, delegated, or completed?
- **Evidence:** Which messages, documents, or records support the interpretation?

Do not refer vaguely to “the person” when a relevant identity is available. Use an appropriate name or role. If a name is unavailable or unnecessary, use a neutral role such as “the requester,” “the project lead,” or “the reviewer.”

## 2. Identify the real task shape

State the task shape in working notes before researching. This prevents collecting information that does not help produce the real deliverable.

| Task shape | What the workflow should produce |
|---|---|
| Reply owed | A concise draft response that answers the request. |
| Artefact owed | A draft document, reference, introduction, summary, data pull, or outline. |
| Decision needed | A short decision brief with options, evidence, a recommendation, and a draft response for the likely choice. |
| Delegation or follow-up | A prepared chase, handoff, scheduling request, or checklist for the responsible person. |
| [Another shape] | [Define the intended outcome and the smallest useful prepared deliverable.] |

A message may contain several sub-asks. Keep them in one task when they share an owner, timing, and context. Split them only when the work has genuinely different owners, deadlines, or tracking needs.

Rewrite the task as an outcome, not as a message label. For example, use “Prepare a response confirming the delivery timeline” rather than “Reply to project chat.”

## 3. Gather only the context that matters

Select sources based on the task, not by running a blanket search. Two or three strong sources are generally better than many shallow ones.

Possible source choices include:

- Prior messages with the requester or on the same topic.
- Project documents, plans, policies, and meeting notes.
- Relevant records in the user's task, customer, hiring, finance, or event systems.
- Linked files and documents mentioned in the conversation.
- Authorized email, calendar, or contact records when they contain the needed decision, logistics, or commitment.
- Public web sources when a factual claim needs external verification.

For a linked document, read the portions needed to understand the whole ask. If it has multiple sections, pages, tabs, or attachments, inspect each relevant part before assuming the message captures all required actions. A short message may point to a document containing several decisions or deliverables.

For hiring, feedback, references, performance, or relationship-sensitive work, use only role-relevant or request-relevant evidence. Focus on observable work, role alignment, concrete examples, and whether an assessment distinguishes relevant performance. Avoid irrelevant personal information, speculation about motives, or unsupported character claims.

For policy questions, first find the applicable existing policy or precedent in the authorized knowledge base. Use it as an anchor, then identify what must change for the new context. Do not assume that a precedent automatically applies without checking legal, organizational, contractual, or local differences.

For repeated questions, search for parallel asks or prior answers. If one well-supported answer can resolve several requests, prepare a reusable response and point requesters to it where appropriate. Do not reveal one conversation's private details to another requester without permission.

### Research stopping rule

Stop when you can do one of the following:

1. Produce a reliable draft or deliverable.
2. Name the exact missing fact, decision, or authorization that blocks progress.
3. Establish that the work is already complete or owned elsewhere.

Do not continue researching merely because more sources exist.

## 4. Pre-complete the work safely

Do as much as is reasonable without making commitments on the user's behalf.

### Reply and writing tasks

If a reply, email, note, or document is needed, follow the user's approved writing guidance if one exists. Otherwise, use a direct, warm, concise style:

- Answer the question early.
- Use concrete facts and examples only where verified.
- Ask the smallest useful follow-up question.
- Avoid ceremonial openings, unnecessary framing, and repeated summaries.
- Use lists only when they improve clarity; place a blank line before a list so the chosen communication system renders it correctly.
- Include coaching or detailed explanation only when it is the point of the response.
- State uncertainty, conditions, and future commitments explicitly.

Keep drafts shorter than a first instinct may suggest. Remove generic compliments, headings that merely announce the answer, and extra advice that does not change the recipient's next action. Prefer one clear question over a long checklist when one answer will unlock the work.

Stage the draft in the user's chosen communication workspace when supported and authorized. Put the same draft in task notes so the record remains useful outside that workspace.

### Decision tasks

Prepare a brief with two or three viable options. For each option, give the relevant evidence, trade-offs, and dependencies. End with a recommendation and why it best fits the stated goals. The purpose is to reduce a decision, not to present an unranked survey.

### Facts, links, and memory gaps

Never invent facts, dates, figures, names, or links. Verify a link through an authorized source or omit it. Use clear placeholders when verification or personal recollection is required:

- `[VERIFY: confirm current figure in the reporting system]`
- `[FILL IN: first-hand example from the event]`
- `[SEARCH: official policy page for travel reimbursement]`

Put essential placeholders directly in the draft rather than silently removing the section. Then state clearly that the draft cannot be sent unchanged. For decisions involving money, contracts, policy exceptions, or commitments, route the draft toward the established approval process rather than implying an informal approval.

### Appropriate autonomy boundary

Drafting is the ceiling for actions that communicate externally or create commitments. Do not send, publish, approve spending, schedule meetings, alter records, or represent the user as having decided unless the user separately performs or explicitly authorizes that action.

## 5. Ask questions only when a real fork remains

Before asking a question, check whether the answer is already present in the thread, a prior message, an approved planning document, or another authorized record. A documented decision should usually beat a fresh question.

Ask only when the missing answer would materially change the draft, decision, owner, or timing. If a reasonable best guess would be cheap to correct, make the guess and disclose it instead.

When questions are necessary, first give one or two short paragraphs of context: who is involved, what has happened, what is now being requested, and the key tension. Then ask two to four targeted questions. Allow combined and free-text answers when the interface supports them.

```markdown
## Decision needed
[Brief context and why this cannot be resolved from the available record.]

1. [Specific choice or fact needed]
2. [Specific choice or fact needed]
3. [Optional question only if it changes the outcome]
```

Do not ask broad questions such as “What do you want to do?” when a smaller decision can unlock the draft.

## 6. Decide whether a task record is worthwhile

Not every message deserves a task record. Skip the record when the work is complete, duplicated, owned by someone else, or can be finished in one short sitting with no need to remember it later.

Prefer a chat-only result when the remaining work is simply to review, lightly edit, and send a prepared draft, typically in about fifteen minutes or less.

Create a record when at least one condition applies:

- The work is deferred or cannot be done now.
- There is a deadline, wait, event, or dependency worth tracking.
- Several steps remain or work will span multiple days.
- A handoff needs clear ownership.
- The user explicitly asked for a task record.

When uncertain, use chat-only for simple reply tasks and a record for multi-step, delayed, or cross-system work.

## 7. Create a task record that can be finished

Use the user's chosen task system and its available fields. Verify the record after creation and open it if the system supports that action.

| Field | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Title | Imperative, specific, and short. Describe the outcome, not the source message. |
| Status | Use the system's equivalent of not started or open. |
| Due date | Add only when a real deadline or meaningful implied timing exists. |
| Importance and urgency | Make a transparent best guess from stakes, waiting parties, and timing. |
| Estimate | Estimate remaining human effort after preparation, not total historical effort. |
| Area or project | Link the best-fit project, responsibility area, or goal. |
| Notes | Include context, evidence links, prepared work, and explicit remaining actions. |

Use this notes template:

```markdown
**What:** [One sentence describing the outcome and who is waiting.]
**Source:** [Conversation or source link]

**Context:**
- [Relevant history or commitment]
- [Verified fact or decision]
- [Relevant source link]

**Pre-completed:**
[Draft reply, decision brief, prepared artefact, or staged-action details.]

**Remaining for the user:**
- [Specific review, decision, or action]
- [Specific follow-up, if any]
```

A good title has a binary finish line. “Confirm delivery timeline and send response” is better than “Supplier message.” A good estimate might be “10 minutes to review and send,” not the time already spent researching.

## 8. Report back clearly

If a task record was created, report in this order:

1. What the task is.
2. What was pre-completed, including where any draft was staged.
3. Metadata guesses: importance, urgency, due date if any, and remaining estimate.
4. Any `[VERIFY]` or `[FILL IN]` items that prevent completion.

If no record was created, sharply separate the briefing from the deliverable. Put the draft last so it can be copied directly.

```markdown
## Context for the user (not part of the reply)
- [What is being asked and who is waiting]
- [Key verified facts and judgment calls]
- [Where the draft is staged, if applicable]
- [Any verification flags]

## The reply
[Draft verbatim]
```

Do not add commentary after the final draft block.

## 9. Run a draft-to-sent learning check when authorized

If a draft was staged and the user has authorized workflow improvement from outcomes, check later whether a final message was sent. Use a bounded schedule, such as one initial check and up to two later checks with longer delays. Stop if no message appears; silence may be intentional.

Compare the staged and sent versions for general lessons: what was cut, clarified, reordered, softened, or added. Update only an approved shared writing guide or workflow playbook. Record general principles, not private conversation details. Do not automatically modify private files or transmit updates unless the user has explicitly authorized that maintenance process.

## 10. Final audit

Before finishing, confirm:

- The full relevant conversation was read.
- Later replies did not resolve or supersede the task.
- Research was relevant, authorized, and minimal.
- Facts and links are verified or visibly marked for verification.
- No external action was sent or committed.
- The prepared deliverable matches the actual task shape.
- Any remaining work is specific and owned.
- A task record exists only when tracking provides real value.
- Sensitive or unrelated personal information has been omitted.
- The final report makes the next human action obvious.

Common failure modes are treating the linked message as the whole request, creating dead tasks after a thread is resolved, searching every possible source instead of the relevant ones, asking questions already answered in written records, drafting around unknown facts without flagging them, and creating administrative records for work that is effectively ready to send. Correct these before closing the workflow.

name: design-a-work-sample
description: Create or improve a short, paid, asynchronous work sample that produces job-relevant evidence and can be scored consistently. Validate that it distinguishes role-relevant performance through simulated submissions.
---

# Design a work sample

Use this workflow to create or improve a short, paid, asynchronous hiring exercise. A good work sample asks candidates to do a realistic, bounded version of the job, produces evidence that is hard to fake, and is quick enough for reviewers to score consistently.

Use it for both new exercises and revisions. Do not use it for interview questions, application-form screeners, or multi-day work trials. If the request could refer to one of those formats, ask which format is needed before proceeding.

## Purpose and principles

A work sample sits between initial screening and interviews. It should help the hiring team answer a narrow question: can this person demonstrate the most important parts of this role under realistic constraints?

A useful work sample does not try to assess everything. Some qualities are better assessed elsewhere:

- Interviews can assess communication, motivation, collaboration, and live reasoning.
- References can assess reliability, integrity, and sustained performance.
- A later trial can assess consistency, judgment over time, and work in real systems.
- Training can often close gaps in a particular tool, internal process, or domain vocabulary.

The work sample should focus on a small number of load-bearing abilities that are both important to the role and observable in a short exercise. Examples include prioritization, practical judgment, clear writing, problem diagnosis, sourcing, execution speed, systems thinking, or the ability to turn ambiguity into useful work.

Default design constraints:

- Make the exercise paid.
- Set a clear expected time limit, commonly two to four hours.
- Use a realistic but fictionalized or safely anonymized scenario.
- Do not ask candidates to produce work that the organization will use commercially unless that use is separately agreed.
- Keep grading time to roughly 20 to 25 minutes per submission.
- Make the exercise self-contained. Candidates should not need access to internal tools, private data, or unavailable stakeholders.
- State the permitted use of AI and evaluate judgment rather than trying to detect AI use through writing style.
- Test only capabilities that are materially related to the role. Exclude protected characteristics and unrelated proxy criteria.
- Offer a clear route for reasonable accommodations or an equivalent accessible format without lowering the role-relevant standard.

## Step 1: Pre-flight

Before designing the work sample, confirm that the hiring team has both of the following:

1. A current job description or role brief that explains responsibilities, level, expected outcomes, and reporting context.
2. A role-success profile, hiring plan, or equivalent document that identifies the capabilities and experience most likely to produce the role's required outcomes.

If either is missing, stop and ask for it. Do not attempt to discover the ideal candidate while designing the test. That creates a moving target and usually produces an exercise that feels plausible but measures the wrong things.

Use this request format:

> Before we design the work sample, I need the role description and a role-success profile or hiring plan. I can help create either one first. Which is missing, and who should confirm it?

If the materials exist, read the full role context. This may include linked project notes, current team constraints, examples of strong work, prior hiring feedback, and any existing exercises for comparable roles. Read one or two reference exercises only to calibrate tone, length, and operational format. Do not copy their task shape automatically. Different roles need different evidence.

Use only hiring materials the team is authorized to use for this role. Minimize private information: read the minimum relevant evidence, omit unrelated or sensitive candidate details, and do not infer protected traits. Keep alignment notes, simulations, and reviewer guidance inside the approved hiring access boundary.

After reviewing, give a brief status update stating what sources were read and move to the alignment memo.

## Step 2: Write the alignment memo before drafting

Do not draft candidate-facing instructions yet. First create a one-page memo titled:

**What we are testing for and why: [Role] work sample**

Include these sections.

### Load-bearing traits

List three to five abilities that this role succeeds or fails on and that can be surfaced in the exercise window. Phrase them as observable capabilities, not vague virtues.

Weak: “Strategic thinking.”

Better: “Can identify the highest-leverage problem in a messy operating situation, explain the tradeoff, and deliver a useful first action.”

### What the exercise will not test

Name important criteria that should be assessed elsewhere. This keeps the test honest and prevents it from growing into an unrealistic proxy for the entire job.

For example, a three-hour written exercise may not fairly test long-term reliability, leadership over months, responsiveness in live meetings, specialized software fluency, or culture contribution.

### Calibration to role level

State whether the role is entry-level, mid-level, senior, or leadership level. Explain what this changes in the exercise:

- Junior candidates may need more context and narrower deliverables.
- Mid-level candidates may need to prioritize and execute independently.
- Senior candidates may need to make tradeoffs, establish direction, and create work another person could use without explanation.

### Failure modes to catch

Identify two or three plausible role-misaligned patterns that could otherwise look strong in a conventional hiring process. Describe observable work patterns rather than labeling people. Examples:

- A polished planner who does not ship usable work.
- A fast executor who misses the central problem or creates avoidable risk.
- A careful but indecisive candidate who defers every meaningful call.
- A technically skilled candidate who cannot communicate with the intended audience.

### What strong looks like

Write one short paragraph describing a top submission. Focus on evidence: what choices it makes, what it notices, what it produces, and how it handles uncertainty.

Present the memo to the hiring owner and ask for explicit confirmation:

> Does this match the abilities and failure modes you want this work sample to assess?

Do not proceed until the owner confirms or revises the memo.

## Step 3: Propose exercise shapes

Once the memo is locked, offer three possible shapes. Each option should test the load-bearing traits in a distinct way, be understandable within about a minute, be self-contained, and be scorable quickly.

For each option, include:

- **Shape:** a plain-language description of the candidate task.
- **What it tests:** the specific load-bearing traits it reveals.
- **Why it is evaluable:** what evidence reviewers would see and why scoring can be consistent.
- **Main risk:** the most likely way the format could create noise or unfairness.

Keep each option concise. Useful shapes include:

- **Triage pile:** The candidate receives a realistic set of messages, requests, and constraints. They prioritize, draft responses or work products, and recommend one systemic improvement. This suits operations, coordination, support, and communications-heavy roles.
- **Choose the highest-leverage action and ship it:** The candidate receives a brief with several possible priorities, selects one, explains the choice, and creates a small usable output. This suits strategic operations and builder roles.
- **Diagnose and fix:** The candidate reviews a messy situation, identifies the key problem, and ships one targeted intervention. This suits product, program, analytical, and process-improvement roles.
- **Source and pitch:** The candidate defines a target profile, identifies promising channels or prospects from provided information, and writes outreach. This suits recruiting, partnerships, sales, and community-growth roles.
- **Decision-useful analysis:** The candidate chooses or is assigned one intervention area, assesses it using supplied evidence, and makes a recommendation for a decision-maker. This suits research, policy, strategy, and specialist knowledge roles.
- **Design a repeatable system:** The candidate creates a lightweight process, playbook, or operating artifact that a teammate could use. This suits program, community, enablement, and operational design roles.

Do not draft the full exercise until the hiring owner chooses a shape. If none are right, generate three more based on the confirmed traits rather than forcing a familiar format.

## Step 4: Draft version 1

Write the candidate-facing exercise in this order.

## [Role] Work Sample

Open with one or two sentences explaining the abilities the exercise assesses. State the total time expected.

**Your mission**

Describe a specific situation, not an abstract assignment. Include enough context to make the work realistic. Where decisiveness is a trait being tested, make clear which stakeholders are unavailable during the exercise so candidates must make reasonable calls instead of deferring everything.

End with one sentence that restates what the candidate will produce.

**Deliverables**

List two to four parts. Include rough time guidance where useful. A common operations pattern is:

- A short prioritization or analysis section.
- Several actual drafts, decisions, or shipped outputs.
- One systemic fix, process improvement, or reusable artifact.

Avoid excessive micro-tasks. A small number of substantive outputs reveals more than dozens of shallow decisions. If planning and execution both matter, explicitly warn candidates not to spend all their time planning.

**Context**

Provide the minimum information needed to complete the exercise: project state, audience, constraints, available resources, relevant policy, and stakeholder availability. Use fictional names, domains, and identifiers unless the hiring owner explicitly approves use of real public information.

For a triage-pile exercise, include eight to ten realistic items. Some should connect so that candidates are rewarded for seeing patterns across the whole situation. Include reference notes that provide any data needed for a fair decision, such as escalation rules, capacity limits, or refund policy.

**Instructions**

Include:

- The expected time limit.
- The submission deadline, written clearly.
- Submission format, such as one document or PDF, plus links to supplementary artifacts if needed.
- Payment amount, payment process, and any early-submission bonus, if offered.
- What tools and AI assistance are permitted.
- A request to document important assumptions briefly.
- Permission to submit incomplete work if time runs out.
- Optional guidance on a short walkthrough video, if this would add useful signal.

Use a transparent AI policy. For example:

> You may use AI tools. Use them carefully and apply your own judgment. We are evaluating the choices, reasoning, and usefulness of your submission. Briefly note any material use of AI tools.

**Anticipated questions**

Include answers to common questions, such as:

- If a requirement is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and state it briefly.
- If you do not finish in the expected time, submit what you have and note what you would do next.
- The work will be used only to evaluate candidates unless another use is agreed separately.

## Candidate-facing writing and format checks

Write in direct, plain US English unless another locale is appropriate. Keep instructions easy to paste into the organization’s chosen hiring system and easy to read in a document.

Before sharing a draft, check that the candidate-facing text:

- Has no tables if the destination system renders tables poorly.
- Avoids horizontal divider lines if they break the destination editor.
- Uses simple headings and bullets.
- Avoids generic AI-sounding slogans, forced contrasts, repetitive sentence patterns, and unnecessary rhetorical flourishes.
- Uses “by the end of [day]” rather than abbreviated phrasing.
- Uses clearly fictional email addresses and names in fictional scenarios.
- Formats multi-line message metadata clearly. If the target editor collapses line breaks, use its supported soft-break method.
- Does not contain confidential details, credentials, private contact information, or sensitive internal data.

After every draft, add a separate section that is not for candidates:

**Notes for the hiring owner (not for the candidate)**

Include three to six concise bullets on choices the owner may want to change. Typical notes include whether an item is too obvious, whether the scenario is realistic enough, whether the payment structure matches role level, whether a deliverable is too prescriptive, or whether a video should be optional.

End with one focused decision question, such as: “Which part should we tighten first?”

## Step 5: Iterate with the hiring owner

Expect multiple rounds. For each revision, provide the complete updated work sample, not only a change list, so it can be copied directly into the selected system.

Apply feedback directly unless it would materially undermine validity, fairness, or safety. If that happens, state the concern once in plain language, offer an alternative, and let the hiring owner decide.

Common revision directions include tightening vague instructions, loosening over-prescriptive tasks, correcting scenario facts, simplifying deliverables, changing payment, and replacing unrealistic details.

## Step 6: Simulate two candidates

Before declaring version 1 complete, simulate two full submissions in parallel using the exact candidate-facing instructions.

### Role-aligned simulation

Use a persona that matches the confirmed role-success profile. Have them complete the actual deliverables under the stated time limit. Ask for a short reflection on their choices, uncertainty, and time allocation.

### Plausible role-misaligned simulation

Use an earnest, capable candidate who could pass ordinary screening but whose demonstrated work lacks one role-critical capability. Choose a relevant mismatch, such as a planner where the role needs a builder, a cautious hedger where it needs decisive judgment, or an executor who cannot see systemic patterns. Keep the difference tied to job evidence, never identity or background.

Have this persona produce the same complete submission.

Then synthesize the results:

1. Where the exercise distinguished role-relevant performance sharply.
2. Where both candidates performed similarly.
3. What the exercise is likely to predict and what it cannot predict.
4. Specific improvements, ranked by likely impact.

Floor checks that both candidates pass are not automatically bad. The concern is when a central trait fails to create meaningfully different evidence.

## Step 7: Apply validation improvements

Revise the full exercise based on the simulation. Target the weakest diagnostic points first. Examples of useful revisions:

- Make connected scenario items more interdependent.
- Remove obvious noise that takes seconds to dismiss.
- Add a concrete constraint that forces a meaningful tradeoff.
- Replace a broad opinion prompt with a usable deliverable.
- Clarify the rubric so reviewers reward the intended behavior.
- Remove specialized knowledge requirements that are trainable and not essential on day one.

Do not make the task harder merely to make it more selective. Make it more diagnostic of the confirmed traits.

## Step 8: Optional external review

If other reviewers provide feedback, assess each suggestion against the alignment memo. State which suggestions to integrate, which to skip, and why. External review is evidence, not an automatic instruction. The hiring owner remains accountable for the assessment design.

## Step 9: Final readiness gate

Do not mark the work sample complete until all of the following are true:

- The role description and role-success profile are confirmed.
- The alignment memo is approved.
- The chosen task shape maps directly to the load-bearing traits.
- The task fits the stated time for a qualified candidate.
- The scenario is self-contained and does not require private access.
- Payment and submission instructions are clear.
- Candidate-facing text is formatted for the destination system.
- A reviewer can score a submission in about 20 to 25 minutes.
- A role-aligned and plausible role-misaligned simulation has been completed.
- The simulation led to any necessary revisions.
- The final version has no sensitive data and does not create unpaid production work.
- Role-relevant criteria, accommodation routes, and potential proxy bias have been checked.

## Common failure modes

Avoid these patterns:

- Designing the task before agreeing what it should measure.
- Testing tool familiarity, domain trivia, or trainable knowledge instead of durable judgment.
- Asking for too many small outputs instead of a few meaningful ones.
- Making every scenario item independent, which tests volume but not pattern recognition.
- Allowing candidates to defer every decision to an available stakeholder when decisiveness is meant to matter.
- Giving vague context that rewards insider knowledge.
- Setting a word-count target that encourages padding.
- Creating a test that takes longer to grade than the signal justifies.
- Treating polished writing or presentation as the main signal when the role requires something else.
- Declaring success without testing whether the exercise distinguishes the role-relevant evidence it was designed to measure.

A finished work sample should feel like a small, fair version of the job: bounded, realistic, useful for assessment, and clear about what good performance looks like.

name: run-a-reference-call
description: Prepare and run a concise reference conversation that gathers specific evidence instead of vague praise.
---

# Run a reference call

Use this when checking a candidate's past work for a hiring decision.

## 1. Prepare from the decision

Read the role outcomes, interview evidence, remaining concerns, and the
candidate's relationship with the referee. Decide which uncertainty the call
must reduce. Do not ask a generic list when the hiring team already knows what
it needs to test.

## 2. Establish context

Confirm how the referee worked with the candidate, for how long, and how closely
they observed the relevant work. Weight evidence by direct observation rather
than title or confidence.

## 3. Ask for examples

Useful questions include:

- What result did the candidate personally own?
- What did strong performance look like in practice?
- Where did they need the most support?
- How did they respond to difficult feedback?
- Which environment helped or hurt their performance?
- What kind of role would you hesitate to place them in?
- Would you choose to work with them again, and in what capacity?

Follow vague praise with “What did that look like?” or “Can you give a specific
example?”

## 4. Test concerns fairly

Ask neutral questions about the hiring team's uncertainties without revealing
private interview judgments or inviting confirmation. Note contradictions and
seek concrete evidence.

## 5. Record signal

Separate observations, the referee's interpretation, and your inference. Record
confidence and any important limits on what the referee could know. Do not turn
one reference into a final verdict on its own.

name: use-a-browser-safely
description: Complete browser-based tasks safely by choosing the least invasive authorized method, protecting account context and privacy, verifying rendered page state, and separating preparation from consequential actions.
---

# Use a browser safely

Use this workflow for tasks that require real interaction with a website: completing rendered forms, changing settings, collecting data from dynamic pages, testing user flows, or working in authenticated dashboards. Use it when ordinary page retrieval, a supported service interface, or a static-page request cannot reliably complete the task.

The central rule is:

> Inspect the rendered page before editing, verify every meaningful change by reading it back, and do not perform a consequential final action until the page state, target, and authorization are clear.

A browser automation command succeeding does **not** prove that a website accepted the change. Modern applications can hold state separately from the visible DOM, commit values only after focus changes, replace controls during re-rendering, or display a misleading error after an action actually completed.

## 1. Choose the least invasive authorized route

Use the first route that safely fits the task:

1. **Supported direct interface or API.** Prefer a documented, authorized programmatic interface when it can perform the requested task. It is usually more reliable than reproducing browser behavior.
2. **Headless browser automation.** Use this for public pages, test environments, routine dynamic-page extraction, screenshots, and forms that do not require the user's established signed-in identity.
3. **User-visible authenticated browser session.** Use this only when the task genuinely needs an existing session, single sign-on state, account-specific dashboard, or user-directed browser context.

Before driving a browser, look for a direct route. Review official documentation, ordinary form actions, page source, and visible network activity for supported endpoints. A form may submit structured data to an authorized service that is safer to use directly.

Do not use undocumented interfaces to bypass access controls, consent boundaries, service restrictions, or other safeguards. Do not use an authenticated visible session merely because it is convenient: it can interrupt the user's work and increases privacy and account risk.

If a site blocks automated browsing, do not attempt to evade its protections for casual research or collection. A user-visible session may be appropriate only when the user explicitly asked to complete a legitimate task on that specific site, has authorized access, and the established session is necessary. Do not weaken browser security, warnings, anti-abuse controls, or access restrictions.

## 2. Protect account identity, privacy, and browser context

When a task accesses private communications, records, dashboards, or information about people, establish a legitimate purpose and clear authorization. Use only the minimum relevant sources and information. Do not copy unrelated personal details into notes, screenshots, logs, or reports. Keep outputs within the requester's appropriate access boundary and respect consent and reasonable privacy expectations.

Before acting in an authenticated context, identify the correct account, organization, environment, and browser profile. Never infer identity from a generic browser-window name, remembered default, old tab title, or arbitrary connection label.

Use these rules:

- Announce when taking control of a visible browser and state the purpose.
- Work in a fresh tab, window, or isolated tab group unless the user explicitly directs work in an existing tab.
- Classify the intended context explicitly: for example, personal, work, test, staging, or production.
- Select the browser profile or connection matching that context. Do not rely on a generic selector that may choose the most recently used profile.
- Confirm the signed-in account using a reliable account indicator before opening or modifying the actual target.
- If the required account, environment, target, or authority is unclear, stop and ask before changing data.
- Do not expose credentials, session tokens, recovery details, private account data, or security settings in outputs or logs.
- Do not disable security controls, multi-factor authentication, browser warnings, or access restrictions to make automation easier.

Use an account preflight gate before actions that change data. Confirm the account identity, environment, and target object. If the automation system provides a verification marker or permission gate, mark the context verified **only after** the account check has actually passed. Never create or enable a marker in advance merely to unlock actions.

A useful pre-action question is: **Which account is this? Which environment is this? What exact item will change?** Resolve uncertainty before proceeding.

## 3. Establish the task boundary

Determine the intended outcome before navigating deeply. Identify:

- The target page, record, form, setting, or workflow.
- The information that will be entered, collected, changed, or uploaded.
- The minimum information needed to complete the request.
- Whether the final action is reversible.
- Whether the task includes sending, publishing, paying, deleting, granting access, changing a plan, or another external commitment.
- Missing information, ambiguous choices, and fields requiring the user's judgment.

Separate **preparation** from **commitment**. Filling fields, drafting text, selecting options, and collecting a preview are often reversible. Submitting, sending, publishing, purchasing, deleting, or applying an irreversible account change may not be.

For consequential tasks, use two phases:

1. **Preparation pass:** Fill or configure the page, verify all values, and capture a pre-action screenshot or structured state record. Do not activate the final control.
2. **Commitment pass:** After explicit confirmation of the prepared state, re-check the account, target, and readiness gate. Then perform the final action once.

If the page reloads, re-renders, or the session changes between passes, do not assume the earlier state remains valid. Restore intended values if necessary and verify them again before committing.

## 4. Inspect the rendered page before editing

Do not begin by guessing selectors, filling fields by numeric position, or trusting a visual approximation. First inspect the rendered page and collect enough structure to identify controls safely.

For each relevant control, determine:

- Element type: single-line input, multiline text area, rich-text editor, dropdown, checkbox, radio group, date picker, upload control, or custom widget.
- Accessible name, visible label, placeholder, or label relationship.
- Current value and whether the field is required.
- Validation rules, character limits, formatting behavior, and disabled state.
- Whether an apparent field is the editable control, a wrapper, or a hidden synchronization element.
- Whether changing a dropdown, checkbox, date, tab, or other control causes the page to re-render.

Address controls by stable semantic identity, such as visible label text, an accessible name, or an explicit label relationship. Do not use DOM indexes where labels are available: dynamic applications can change element order between loads or after re-rendering.

Before changing a record or setting, inspect its current state. This prevents modifying the wrong item or overwriting values unintentionally.

### Generic inspection record

Use the chosen browser automation capability to list relevant controls before writing fill logic. Record at least tag, input type, role, label, required state, and current value or text length.

```js
// Pseudocode: adapt to the selected automation library.
const controls = inspectAll('input, textarea, [contenteditable="true"], [role="textbox"]')
  .map((element) => ({
    tag: element.tagName,
    type: element.type || element.contentEditable,
    role: element.getAttribute('role'),
    label: accessibleLabel(element),
    required: element.required || element.getAttribute('aria-required') === 'true',
    valueLength: readableValue(element).length,
  }));

saveJson('form-before.json', controls);
```

Store inspection records and screenshots only where authorized users can access them. For sensitive values, record lengths, field names, hashes, or redacted summaries rather than full content when that is sufficient for verification.

## 5. Use the right interaction for each control

Different controls need different interactions. A generic “set value” operation is not reliable for all of them.

| Control type | Preferred interaction | Verification concern |
|---|---|---|
| Single-line input | Use the normal text-input mechanism. | Line breaks may be removed silently. |
| Multiline text area | Fill text, then move focus away. | Some applications commit only on blur. |
| Rich-text or content-editable editor | Focus the actual editor, select existing content, enter text through keyboard-style events, then blur. | Direct DOM mutation may not update the application's internal model. |
| Dropdown or combobox | Open it, select by visible option text, then wait for state to settle. | Selection can trigger a full re-render. |
| Checkbox or radio control | Read current state first; change only if needed. | A click can toggle an already-correct value. |
| Date/time picker | Choose date and time, then verify the rendered summary. | Popovers can reinterpret typing or clear related fields. |
| File upload | Confirm file, destination, and privacy implications first. | Uploading may begin immediately and can be difficult to undo. |

For framework-driven editors, simulate normal user interaction rather than writing directly to low-level page properties. A robust general sequence is: focus the actual editable element, select existing text, delete it, enter the new text with keyboard-style events, move focus to a neutral page element, wait briefly, and read the result back.

Some forms pair a visible rich-text editor with a hidden input. Editing the hidden input may appear successful in an inspection record while server-side validation treats the visible editor as empty. Target the control that the user interacts with and that the application actually reads. If a generic accessibility locator resolves to an empty wrapper, inspect the underlying editable element and follow its label relationship.

If changing a dropdown, checkbox, tab, or date can refresh the form, make and verify those selections **before** filling lengthy or complex text. Re-inspect afterward and confirm earlier entries remain present.

### Generic robust form sequence

Use this ordering for complex dynamic forms:

1. Inspect controls and current state.
2. Set choices likely to cause a re-render, such as category, checkbox, dropdown, or date.
3. Wait for the page to settle and inspect affected controls again.
4. Fill text fields by label or accessible relationship, not by element index.
5. Blur and verify each field before moving to the next field.
6. Run the readiness gate and capture the pre-action record.
7. Obtain confirmation if the action is consequential.
8. Submit once and verify the outcome.

## 6. Verify after every meaningful edit

After each field is filled or setting is changed, read its value back from the page. Compare the actual visible or accessible value with the intended value. For sensitive content, compare lengths, required state, or a minimal redacted summary rather than exposing the full value unnecessarily.

Check for these common mismatches:

- The automation layer reports success but the field is empty in page state.
- Newlines, repeated spaces, punctuation, or special characters were removed.
- Text was truncated because the control is single-line or has a length limit.
- A custom editor displayed text but did not retain it internally.
- A later action erased an earlier field after a re-render.
- A hidden synchronization field was changed instead of the visible editor.
- A selection changed a dependent field, date, recipient, or validation requirement.

If verification fails, do not continue toward submission. Diagnose the control type, retry once using a more appropriate interaction method, then verify again. If the page continues to reject or alter the value, report the limitation and ask how to proceed rather than silently submitting incorrect content.

## 7. Run a pre-submit readiness gate

Before any final submission or high-impact change, inspect the full relevant page state again. Confirm all of the following:

- The correct account, organization, and environment are active.
- The target item is the intended one.
- Every required field is present and non-empty.
- Each entered value matches the intended content closely enough for the task.
- Dropdowns, checkboxes, dates, recipients, attachments, and dependent fields are correct.
- No validation errors, warnings, or unsaved-change indicators remain.
- The final button has the intended effect and is not a similarly named destructive alternative.

If a required field is blank, a value cannot be verified, or the target is uncertain, **refuse to submit**. A partially filled form is recoverable; an incorrect external action may not be.

Capture a pre-action record when useful: a screenshot, concise state summary, or structured field dump. Store and share it only through an appropriate access boundary. Avoid exposing sensitive form values in a large inline table when a short summary and securely available record are sufficient.

### Readiness checklist

- [ ] The account, environment, and target were verified.
- [ ] Relevant controls were inspected before editing.
- [ ] Every meaningful change was read back.
- [ ] Required fields are non-empty and validation is clear.
- [ ] Dependencies such as recipients, dates, attachments, and options were checked.
- [ ] A pre-action record exists for a consequential task.
- [ ] The final action and its impact are understood.

## 8. Treat one-way actions as a distinct phase

The following generally need explicit confirmation immediately before the final control is activated:

- Sending messages, invitations, or notifications.
- Publishing content.
- Submitting an official or externally reviewed form.
- Making a payment or purchase.
- Deleting records or files.
- Changing subscription, billing, access, ownership, or security settings.
- Actions labeled permanent, final, irreversible, or impossible to edit later.

Use a concise confirmation request:

> The page is prepared for **[target]**. The final action will **[send/publish/submit/change]** **[important effect]**. Key details checked: **[recipients, amount, date, audience, or other relevant values]**. **[Open question or “No open questions.”]** Shall I proceed?

Wait for confirmation before activating the final control. For low-risk reversible changes explicitly requested by the user, such as adjusting a preference or updating a draft, proceed after normal verification unless the page presents an unexpected warning or broader impact.

## 9. Confirm completion after acting

A button click is not proof of success. After the final action, look for reliable evidence such as a success message, confirmation reference, newly created record, persisted saved setting, sent or published item, or changed status that remains after a safe reload.

If the site reports an error, preserve the relevant error text and inspect the resulting state before retrying. A visible error can be cosmetic, while blind retries can create duplicate requests, payments, messages, or records.

If completion cannot be verified, report what was attempted, what evidence exists, and what remains uncertain. Do not represent an attempted action as completed.

## 10. Failure patterns and safe recovery

| Symptom | Likely explanation | Safe response |
|---|---|---|
| Automation reports success but the field is blank | The application ignored a direct value change. | Use focus-and-keyboard interaction, blur, then read back. |
| Earlier fields disappear after editing a later one | A component re-render reset uncommitted state. | Commit and verify each field; perform re-rendering controls first. |
| Text loses line breaks or characters | The wrong control type or formatting rule was used. | Find a multiline or editor control, or use an explicitly acceptable simplified format. |
| A locator finds an empty wrapper | The accessible element is not the editable node. | Inspect the underlying labeled control and target the true editor. |
| A field looks correct but validation says it is empty | A hidden synchronization field was edited. | Use the visible interactive control that the application actually reads. |
| Browser automation becomes unstable on a complex page | The chosen automation layer is unsuitable. | Switch to a more robust browser method or supported direct interface; do not blindly rescue a broken session. |
| Headless and normal browsers show different behavior | The site varies behavior by browser context. | Prefer an authorized direct interface; if needed for an explicit task, use a verified visible session without evading protections. |
| A popup changes dates or fields unexpectedly | The widget has stateful close, clear, or parsing behavior. | Close it through a neutral page action and re-verify affected fields. |
| A visible error may be cosmetic | The task may already have completed. | Inspect resulting state before retrying. |
| The account context is uncertain | The wrong profile or environment may be active. | Stop, verify a reliable account indicator, and ask if uncertainty remains. |

## Final audit checklist

Before reporting completion, verify:

- [ ] The least invasive suitable route was used.
- [ ] The task had a legitimate purpose and appropriate authorization.
- [ ] Only the minimum relevant private information was accessed and retained.
- [ ] The correct account, environment, and target were confirmed.
- [ ] Relevant controls were inspected before editing.
- [ ] Every meaningful change was read back and verified.
- [ ] Required fields and validation state passed the readiness gate.
- [ ] A pre-action record was captured when the action was consequential.
- [ ] Explicit confirmation was obtained immediately before a consequential final action.
- [ ] Success was verified after the action.
- [ ] The report distinguishes confirmed results from uncertainty.
- [ ] No credentials, session data, or unnecessary personal content was exposed.

name: create-an-ai-skill
description: A complete workflow for designing, testing, improving, and packaging a reusable AI skill from a new idea, an existing draft, or a repeated workflow captured from a conversation.
---

# Create an AI skill

Use this workflow to create a new reusable AI skill, revise an existing one, assess whether it works, or improve when it triggers. A skill is a focused set of instructions and optional supporting resources that helps an AI perform a recurring job consistently.

The core loop is:

1. Understand the job and its boundaries.
2. Draft or revise the skill.
3. Test it on realistic requests.
4. Let a person review representative outputs and measure objective requirements where appropriate.
5. Improve the skill based on evidence.
6. Repeat until the result is useful, reliable, and not overfitted to the tests.
7. Optionally improve the skill description so it triggers for the right requests.

Do not assume every project needs every step. A user may want a quick draft, a collaborative “good enough” pass, or a rigorous benchmark. Identify where they are in the loop and help them move forward from there.

## Communication principles

Match the user’s technical vocabulary and experience. Use plain language by default. Terms such as *evaluation* or *benchmark* may be useful, but briefly explain them when needed. Avoid unexplained terms such as “schema,” “assertion,” or “JSON” unless the user is comfortable with them.

When asking questions, explain why the answer matters. For example, instead of asking only “What is the output format?”, say: “What should a successful result look like—an answer in chat, a structured report, a file, or an action? This determines how we test completion.”

Keep the user involved at decision points:

- Confirm the intended job before writing extensive instructions.
- Ask before choosing a restrictive scope, tool requirement, or approval policy.
- Share proposed test cases before relying on them.
- Let human judgment lead for subjective quality such as tone, visual design, or creative usefulness.

## 1. Determine the starting point

First identify which situation applies.

### A. New skill

The user has an idea such as “I need a skill that helps with recurring project status reports.” Start with discovery and a first draft.

### B. Existing draft or installed skill

The user already has instructions and wants them edited, simplified, tested, or optimized. Preserve the established skill identity unless the user explicitly asks to rename it. Read the current instructions before proposing changes.

### C. Workflow already demonstrated in the conversation

The user may say “turn what we just did into a skill.” Extract as much as possible from the conversation before asking questions:

- Inputs the user supplied.
- Tools or information sources used.
- The order of decisions and actions.
- Corrections the user made.
- Output format and acceptance criteria.
- Conditions where the workflow changed direction.

Summarize the inferred workflow and list gaps for confirmation. Do not silently turn a one-time solution into a general rule without checking whether it applies broadly.

### D. Evaluation or optimization request

The user may already have a finished-looking skill and want to know whether it helps. Go directly to test design, evaluation, and revision. Do not rewrite it merely because a rewrite is possible.

## 2. Capture intent and scope

Before drafting, gather enough detail to define a coherent job. Use the following questions, adapting them to the user’s context.

1. **Purpose:** What should this skill enable the AI to accomplish?
2. **Trigger:** What kinds of user requests, wording, or situations should activate it?
3. **Inputs:** What information, files, examples, systems, or permissions can it use?
4. **Outputs:** What should it produce or change? Is there a required format?
5. **Success:** How will the user know the output is correct or useful?
6. **Boundaries:** What should the skill explicitly not do? When should it ask a question, decline, or hand work back to the user?
7. **Variations:** What common cases, difficult cases, or exceptions matter?
8. **Dependencies:** Does the workflow require particular capabilities, reference material, templates, scripts, or user-provided access?
9. **Testing:** Should the skill be tested with example requests? Recommend testing when outputs can be checked objectively, when the workflow is consequential, or when the skill will be used repeatedly.

Do not ask every question mechanically. Start with the missing information that most affects the design. If useful, offer choices:

- “Should the skill make a best effort when information is missing, or stop and ask?”
- “Should it produce a concise summary, a detailed report, or let the user choose?”
- “Should it work with any data source, or only sources the user has approved?”

### Research before drafting

If the environment provides relevant documentation, similar skills, user-approved reference materials, or domain guidance, review them before drafting. Research should reduce burden on the user rather than replace their authority over requirements.

Use research to identify:

- Existing conventions or output standards.
- Constraints imposed by an available tool or file format.
- Reusable patterns from comparable tasks.
- Safety, privacy, compliance, or approval requirements.

If sources conflict or requirements are uncertain, present the uncertainty rather than guessing.

## 3. Choose the skill’s structure

A skill should be focused enough that users and the AI can predict what it does. One skill can support variants of the same job, but unrelated jobs should be separate skills when they have different audiences, permissions, sources of truth, or definitions of completion.

A typical skill package contains:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                 # Core instructions
├── scripts/                 # Optional deterministic helpers
├── references/              # Optional documentation loaded when needed
├── assets/                  # Optional templates or output resources
└── evals/                   # Optional test cases and evaluation material
```

Use progressive disclosure:

1. **Metadata:** A short name and description that help decide when to activate the skill.
2. **Core instructions:** The workflow needed on most uses.
3. **Supporting resources:** Detailed references, templates, or scripts consulted only when relevant.

Keep the core instructions readable. If they become large, move domain-specific material into clearly named reference files and tell the AI exactly when to read each one. For large reference material, include a table of contents or navigation section.

Organize multi-variant skills by variant. For example, a deployment skill may have one core selection workflow plus separate references for different hosting environments. The AI should choose and read only the relevant variant instead of loading all material by default.

### Use scripts for repeatable deterministic work

If test runs show the AI repeatedly reconstructing the same helper procedure—such as file conversion, report generation, validation, or data cleanup—consider bundling a reusable script. A script is valuable when it is:

- Deterministic or easier to verify than natural-language reasoning.
- Reused across requests.
- Safer or less error-prone than repeated manual reconstruction.
- Clearly within the user’s intended permission scope.

Document what the script does, what inputs it accepts, expected outputs, and when not to use it. Do not bundle unnecessary automation merely because it is possible.

## 4. Write the skill

Draft the skill in clear, imperative language. Explain the reasoning behind important instructions, especially when a rule prevents a predictable failure. AI systems generally perform better when they understand the goal and tradeoff than when they receive a long list of unexplained prohibitions.

A useful skill normally includes the following sections as applicable.

## Purpose and scope

State the job, intended users, and boundaries. Make clear whether the skill creates an answer, produces a file, takes an action, or guides the user through a process.

## Inputs and prerequisites

List required information, permitted sources, needed capabilities, and optional inputs. State what to do when a required item is absent.

Example:

```markdown
Before preparing the report, confirm the reporting period and approved data source.
If the source is unavailable, ask the user for an export or offer a draft marked as incomplete.
```

## Workflow

Give the normal sequence of actions. Include decision points rather than trying to enumerate every possible scenario.

A durable workflow often follows this pattern:

1. Inspect the request and available inputs.
2. Confirm unclear requirements only when the answer materially changes the work.
3. Gather evidence from approved sources.
4. Perform the task using the appropriate method.
5. Check the result against the requested format and success criteria.
6. Present the result, assumptions, and unresolved limitations.

Use conditional rules where needed:

```markdown
If the request provides a required template, follow it.
If no template is provided, use the default report structure below.
If the user requests a change that could overwrite important work, describe the impact and request confirmation before proceeding.
```

## Output format

When consistency matters, define an exact or near-exact template. For example:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Summary
[One short paragraph]

## Findings
- [Finding with evidence]

## Recommendations
1. [Action]

## Assumptions and open questions
- [Any uncertainty]
```

Avoid rigid formatting when the task’s value depends on adapting to context. In that case, give goals and examples instead of a fixed shell.

## Quality and safety checks

State the checks needed before completion. Examples include confirming required fields, validating calculations, citing the source of key claims, preserving original data, or flagging uncertainty.

Skills must behave in ways the user would reasonably expect from their description. Do not design instructions that conceal actions, bypass authorization, extract confidential information, damage systems, or enable unauthorized access. If the requested task is unsafe, deceptive, or exceeds the available authority, explain the limitation and offer a safe alternative where possible.

## Failure behavior

Describe how to recover from common failures in general terms:

- Missing or conflicting input: identify the gap and ask a focused question.
- Unavailable tool or reference: explain what could not be verified and offer an alternate method.
- Ambiguous request: make a reasonable low-risk assumption when it will not materially affect the result; otherwise ask.
- Validation failure: do not present the output as complete; correct it, report the issue, or request guidance.
- Permission-sensitive action: pause for confirmation before an irreversible, external, or high-impact action.

## Examples

Include a small number of generalized examples only when they teach a distinct pattern. Examples should show the shape of a good response, not become a narrow substitute for reasoning.

## 5. Write a strong description

The skill description is primarily a routing instruction: it helps an AI decide whether the skill applies to a user request. It should state both **what the skill does** and **when to use it**.

Write descriptions that cover realistic user language, including requests that imply the job without naming it directly. AI systems may fail to activate a useful skill unless the description makes relevance clear.

A good description includes:

- The task or outcome.
- Common contexts or user phrasing that indicate the task.
- Important scope limits when they prevent harmful or costly false activation.

Example pattern:

```text
Create clear project status reports from approved updates and source material. Use when a user asks for a status update, leadership summary, progress report, milestone review, or a concise account of risks and next steps, even if they do not use the phrase “status report.”
```

Do not put the entire procedure in the description. Do not rely on vague labels such as “help with documents.” Do not make the description so broad that it captures nearby work better handled by another skill.

## 6. Review the draft before testing

Read the skill again as if encountering it for the first time. Check:

- Is the job coherent and bounded?
- Does the description say when to activate it?
- Are required inputs, permissions, and outputs clear?
- Does the workflow explain why important checks matter?
- Are there unnecessary rules, repeated guidance, or brittle wording?
- Does it tell the AI what to do when information is missing?
- Does it avoid assuming a specific person’s tools, habits, access, or terminology?
- Would a capable AI have enough freedom to handle normal variation?

Prefer a lean, understandable prompt over a long prompt filled with rules that do not affect outcomes. Excessive “always” and “never” language is a warning sign unless the behavior is truly non-negotiable, such as a safety or authorization boundary.

## 7. Design realistic test cases

After the draft is stable enough to test, create a small evaluation set. Start with two or three realistic prompts that resemble genuine user requests. Show them to the user and invite additions or corrections.

For each test case, record:

- A descriptive identifier or name.
- The user prompt.
- Any input files or supplied context.
- The expected outcome in plain language.
- Objective checks, if suitable.

A portable structure is:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "example-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": "missing-source-handling",
      "prompt": "Prepare a weekly summary from the attached updates. Flag information you cannot verify.",
      "expected_output": "A structured summary that separates verified updates from missing information.",
      "files": [],
      "assertions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Use test cases that cover different meaningful situations:

- A typical successful request.
- A request with incomplete or ambiguous input.
- A format-sensitive or rule-sensitive request.
- A realistic edge case that changes the workflow.
- A request that should cause the skill to ask for approval or decline an unsafe action, when relevant.

Do not write tests that only mirror the wording of the skill. Vary phrasing, detail level, and user sophistication. Avoid one-off personal scenarios; test the general category of challenge instead.

## 8. Run comparisons

When the environment supports independent runs, compare the skill against a meaningful baseline.

- **For a new skill:** Run each test once with the skill and once without it.
- **For an existing skill:** Save an unchanged snapshot before editing, then compare the revised skill against the previous version.

Launch the skill and baseline runs under comparable conditions. If parallel execution is available, start both configurations for every test case at the same time. This reduces timing differences and prevents selectively changing the baseline later.

Store outputs in a clear iteration structure, for example:

```text
workspace/
├── iteration-1/
│   ├── typical-request/
│   │   ├── with-skill/
│   │   └── baseline/
│   └── incomplete-input/
│       ├── with-skill/
│       └── baseline/
└── iteration-2/
```

For each run, preserve the prompt, supplied files, output, and available run metadata such as elapsed time and token or compute use. Record timing immediately when the execution environment reports it; some systems do not retain this information afterward.

If independent agents or parallel execution are unavailable, perform a transparent sanity check instead: follow the skill for each test prompt, save outputs, and ask the user to review them. Do not claim that this is a rigorous baseline comparison.

## 9. Define and grade objective checks

While runs are underway, draft objective checks where they genuinely help. Explain the checks to the user before treating them as success criteria.

Good checks are specific, observable, and meaningful. Examples:

- Required sections are present.
- A produced file opens and has the required fields.
- Calculated values match a known source within an agreed tolerance.
- The response identifies missing mandatory inputs.
- Output contains citations or source references when required.

Each check should have a descriptive name, a pass/fail result, and evidence. Use a stable record shape such as:

```json
{
  "expectations": [
    {
      "text": "Includes an assumptions section when source information is missing.",
      "passed": true,
      "evidence": "The final section lists two unavailable data points and requests them."
    }
  ]
}
```

Use scripts for programmatic checks whenever practical. Automated checks are more repeatable than visual inspection and can be reused across iterations.

Do not force numerical checks onto subjective tasks. Writing quality, usefulness, tone, aesthetics, and strategic judgment often need human review. A weak proxy metric can make a skill optimize for the metric instead of the user’s real goal.

## 10. Review results with a human

Present both the outputs and the measurements. Use any available review interface that lets the user inspect each test case, compare configurations, and leave feedback. If no such interface exists, present results clearly in the conversation or as accessible files.

For each test case, show:

- The original prompt.
- Relevant supplied inputs.
- The skill output and the comparison output, if available.
- Objective grades and evidence.
- Timing or resource data, if available.
- A place for the user to state what worked and what should change.

Ask focused questions such as:

- “Which result would you trust in normal use, and why?”
- “Did the skill add steps or detail that were not valuable?”
- “What was missing, misleading, or hard to use?”
- “Would this work for similar requests with different wording or data?”

Empty feedback can indicate that a case is acceptable, but do not interpret it as proof that all cases are solved. Look at the output and measurement data too.

## 11. Analyze results beyond pass rates

Aggregate results across tests when possible: pass rate, average time, average resource use, and variation. Put the revised skill before the comparison condition in reports so comparison is easy to read.

Then perform an analyst pass. Aggregate numbers can conceal important patterns. Look for:

- **Non-discriminating checks:** A check passes for both the skill and baseline, so it does not measure the skill’s value.
- **High variance:** A result differs substantially between comparable runs, suggesting ambiguity, environmental instability, or an unreliable instruction.
- **Tradeoffs:** The skill may improve quality but add excessive time or resource use.
- **Failure concentration:** Several failures may share one root cause, such as unclear source selection or missing output rules.
- **Unproductive work:** Execution traces may show repeated planning, redundant research, or unnecessary formatting.
- **Repeated reconstruction:** Multiple runs independently create the same helper procedure, suggesting a bundled resource would help.

Do not treat a small benchmark as conclusive. Use it as evidence for the next revision.

## 12. Improve without overfitting

Base revisions on user feedback, outputs, and analysis. Change the smallest part of the skill likely to address the underlying cause.

Generalize from a complaint. For example, if one output omitted a required source note, do not merely add a rule that mentions the exact test scenario. Instead, clarify the broader condition: when evidence comes from incomplete or mixed sources, distinguish verified information from assumptions.

Use these improvement principles:

1. **Fix causes, not examples.** Design for many future requests, not only the current tests.
2. **Keep instructions lean.** Remove guidance that does not change behavior or causes wasted effort.
3. **Explain intent.** State why an action protects quality, usability, or safety.
4. **Add reusable assets only when justified.** Bundle scripts, templates, or references when repeated work proves their value.
5. **Preserve useful behavior.** Avoid changing a skill so broadly that it loses the parts users already value.
6. **Expand coverage gradually.** Add a new test when it represents a real class of failure, not every isolated incident.

After revision, rerun the full test set in a new iteration. Retest baselines using the same comparison policy. Show the new outputs alongside prior outputs where possible, then collect feedback again.

Stop when one or more of these conditions is true:

- The user says the skill is ready.
- User feedback is consistently positive or empty across meaningful cases.
- Objective requirements are reliably met.
- Further revisions are not producing meaningful improvement.
- Remaining weaknesses require missing information, unavailable capabilities, or a product decision rather than better instructions.

## 13. Optional blind comparison

For a more rigorous comparison of two skill versions, use blind review. Give an independent evaluator two outputs without identifying which came from which version. Ask it to judge against a shared rubric, then reveal the mapping only after the judgment is recorded.

Blind comparison is useful when:

- Two versions have similar pass rates but different qualitative quality.
- The author or user may be biased toward a newer version.
- A decision has material cost or importance.

Keep the comparison rubric tied to user value: correctness, completeness, clarity, adherence to constraints, safety, and practical usability. Analyze why the preferred output won before editing the skill again.

## 14. Optimize triggering behavior

Once the workflow itself is stable, evaluate the description that controls activation. Do this after, not before, the skill is otherwise useful.

Create a set of realistic trigger queries containing both cases that **should trigger** and nearby cases that **should not trigger**. Include roughly balanced coverage, with enough detail that using a skill would actually help.

Positive cases should vary in wording and context:

- Formal and casual phrasing.
- Requests that name the task directly and requests that imply it.
- Common use cases and less common but valid cases.
- Cases where another related skill might compete but this skill should be selected.

Negative cases should be difficult near-misses, not obviously irrelevant requests. They should share terms or concepts with the skill but belong to another job, require a different capability, or lack the conditions that make this skill appropriate.

Example format:

```json
[
  {
    "query": "I need a concise update for leadership from these team notes, including risks and next steps.",
    "should_trigger": true
  },
  {
    "query": "Can you explain what a project status report is and when teams use one?",
    "should_trigger": false
  }
]
```

Review this query set with the user before using it. Poor trigger tests produce misleading descriptions.

Evaluate candidate descriptions repeatedly if the environment supports it, because activation can vary. Separate queries used to improve the description from held-out queries used to select the final description. Choose the description that performs best on held-out cases, not merely the one that best fits the examples used during editing.

Remember that a simple request may not activate a specialized skill even when the description matches: an AI may handle an easy one-step task directly. Trigger tests should therefore describe substantive requests where consulting the skill would be useful.

When applying the selected description, show the user the before-and-after text and the evaluation results. Ensure the final description remains honest about the skill’s scope.

## 15. Package and hand off

When the skill is ready, package the core instructions and only the resources needed for normal use. Before delivery, audit the package:

- The name is stable and appropriate.
- The description accurately describes activation conditions.
- Instructions do not depend on private local conventions, personal access, or undeclared tools.
- References and scripts are present, named clearly, and documented.
- No confidential data, credentials, identifiers, or sensitive examples are included.
- The user can understand how to install, access, or adapt the package in their chosen environment.
- Test material is included only if it is safe and useful to retain.

Provide a short handoff note explaining what the skill does, any required capabilities, known limitations, and how the user can test it after installation.

## Final readiness gate

A skill is ready when it has a clear job, a description that routes appropriate requests, instructions that handle normal variation, explicit boundaries for uncertainty and permissions, and evidence from realistic use that it improves outcomes.

Do not confuse a long instruction file with a reliable skill. The goal is a reusable workflow that helps an AI make better decisions and deliver better results for the user’s real recurring work.

name: test-every-screen-size
description: Verify every UI and CSS change across a configurable set of narrow, wide, short, and tall viewports using screenshots and programmatic layout checks. Fix underlying failures, then rerun the relevant sweep before reporting completion.
---

# Test every screen size

Use this workflow after **any UI, visual, or CSS change** and before declaring work complete, requesting review, publishing, or releasing. Apply it even to small spacing, color, or background edits: local changes can alter wrapping, height, overflow, alignment, and backgrounds at other screen sizes.

A bounding-box check alone is not enough. One desktop and one mobile screenshot are not enough. Real screenshots and numerical checks cover different failure modes, so use both.

## 1. Prepare realistic states

Run the real interface in an authorized test environment. Populate the changed surface with representative content before testing:

- Long paragraphs, formatted text, long field values, and validation messages.
- Representative lists, cards, rows, and realistic item counts.
- Loading, empty, and error states when the change can affect them.
- Content near expected limits, including long unbroken strings where relevant.

Do not validate only an empty or unusually clean state. Sparse content can hide clipping, overlap, wrapping failures, and unintended blank space.

## 2. Select the viewport matrix

Use this as a broadly useful baseline width sweep:

- 320 px
- 480 px
- 600 px
- 720 px
- 1024 px
- 1440 px

Add a large desktop width, such as 1920 px, when large displays are a supported or expected use case. Add any viewport required by product requirements, supported-device policy, usage data, or the reported issue.

When vertical layout matters, test at least two heights at each relevant width:

- A short viewport of roughly 700 px.
- A tall viewport of roughly 1400 px or greater.

Explicitly include a very tall viewport, such as 1800 px, for changes involving viewport-height sizing, flexible page shells, page backgrounds, vertical padding, sticky footers, or bottom alignment. These layouts can appear correct at ordinary heights while leaving an exposed region or misplaced content on tall screens.

Use a repeatable browser automation system chosen for the project. Prefer headless capture for consistent automated results; use an interactive browser only when it is needed to diagnose a failure.

## 3. Capture and review screenshots

Capture real screenshots at every relevant viewport and state. Use full-page captures when document length matters. Also capture the visible viewport when fixed, sticky, or viewport-height behavior matters.

Inspect each changed component on all four sides:

1. Top.
2. Right.
3. Bottom.
4. Left.

For each side, ask: **Does this match the intended design now that the component has changed role?**

Give extra attention to edge-to-edge or full-bleed changes. Removing containment on one edge can reveal leftover margins or wrapper padding on another edge as visible background strips. A flush component should be checked for unintended space on every side, not only the side edited.

Reread the requested outcome after making the change, then compare it directly with the screenshots. Do not accept the result solely because the CSS appears logically correct.

## 4. Run programmatic checks at each viewport

Run numerical checks alongside screenshots. At minimum, verify:

| Check | Example pass condition |
|---|---|
| Horizontal overflow | The page has no unintended horizontal scrolling or clipped content. |
| Fit-to-viewport layout | Where the design is intended to fit, document height is no more than viewport height plus a small rendering tolerance. |
| Overlap | Adjacent elements and intended containers do not have intersecting bounding rectangles unless overlap is intentional. |
| Control access | Buttons, links, and fields are visible, enabled when expected, and reachable without unintended clipping. |
| Fixed or sticky UI | Fixed elements do not hide essential content or actions. |
| Text readability | Main body text stays within the project's accepted line-length range. |

For a fit-to-viewport screen, a typical check compares `document.documentElement.scrollHeight` to `window.innerHeight`, allowing a small tolerance for rendering differences. For overlap detection, compare the bounding rectangles of changed elements, adjacent content, and their containers.

For prose-heavy pages, flag excessively wide text. A useful warning threshold is about 80 characters per line; reading-focused layouts commonly target roughly 60–70 characters per line. Treat this as a design review signal, not a substitute for the project's typography requirements.

## 5. Require both kinds of evidence

Automated measurements can miss exposed background strips, poor visual balance, and unexpected empty regions. Screenshots can miss off-screen overflow, inaccessible controls, and small collisions.

A viewport passes only when the screenshot review and all relevant programmatic checks pass.

## 6. Fix failures and retest

If any viewport or realistic state fails:

1. Stop completion, review, publishing, or release claims.
2. Identify the layout rule causing the failure.
3. Fix the underlying behavior rather than adding a narrow viewport-specific patch.
4. Rerun the complete relevant sweep, including the states and axes affected by the change.

If a change makes one viewport correct but breaks another, reconsider the diagnosis. The layout model is likely incomplete; do not accumulate patches until screenshots happen to look acceptable.

## 7. Readiness gate and reporting

Do not report vague claims such as “works on mobile and desktop.” State the widths, meaningful height cases, states, and checks actually completed.

Use a report such as:

> Verified at 320, 480, 600, 720, 1024, and 1440 px; tested short and tall layouts where relevant; no unintended overflow or overlap; controls remain visible and usable; tall-viewport review passed.

If any viewport or state remains unverified, say so clearly and do not represent the UI change as complete.

name: run-a-recurring-community-event
description: Create and publish the next occurrence of a recurring community event, prepare fresh materials, invite the approved audience, and verify the live result across the chosen tools.
---

# Run a recurring community event

Use this workflow for a repeated social, sports, learning, volunteer, or community event. Adapt it to the organizer's chosen calendar, event platform, image-creation tool, storage location, and communication channels.

## Set authority and boundaries

Before taking external actions, establish which mode applies:

- **Prepare only:** create materials and an unpublished draft.
- **Review before publish:** prepare the event, then request approval before publishing or inviting.
- **Standing authorization:** publish and send invitations under a documented audience policy.

Standing authorization should state the recurrence, normal audience, platform, and any limits. Ask for a decision if the occurrence introduces a material change, such as a new audience, paid admission, changed venue, unusual safety concern, or altered privacy setting.

## 1. Determine the next occurrence

Calculate the date from the recurrence rule and local time zone; do not rely on mental arithmetic. Confirm the date, weekday, start time, end time, venue, and host arrangement.

If events are numbered, inspect prior occurrences and use the next number after the highest existing one. Include early unnumbered events when reviewing the series history.

Check for relevant conflicts such as holidays, venue closures, organizer availability, or weather-sensitive conditions. A conflict does not automatically cancel the event. Follow the organizer's policy; if the event proceeds, report the conflict and any remaining handoff or cancellation decision.

## 2. Reuse stable information and update changing details

Review the latest event or two before creating the new one. Separate details into:

- **Stable details:** purpose, usual format, meeting point, regular instructions, contact route, and accessibility guidance.
- **Occurrence-specific details:** date, sequence number, hosts, route, weather plan, capacity, theme, and exceptions.

Use the approved title pattern and description template. Update every changing detail deliberately. Do not carry forward stale dates, expired links, temporary announcements, or venue instructions that no longer apply.

## 3. Prepare event artwork when needed

If the series uses recurring visuals, keep a recognizable identity while making each new image distinct. Review recent artwork first so the next concept is not a minor variation of the last one.

Create an image brief containing:

- event name or required text;
- the core activity or recognizable symbols;
- desired style and mood;
- one new central visual idea; and
- quality constraints for the selected image capability.

Vary the main idea through season, light, weather, viewpoint, local texture, an activity detail, or one small humorous focal object. Prefer one clear subject over a crowded scene. Request clean composition, restrained color, readable text, and no obvious generation artifacts.

Review the result before use. If it repeats recent work or contains visible defects, revise the concept and regenerate a limited number of times. Do not retry indefinitely. Before treating a tool error as a failed generation, check whether the requested image was actually produced.

Export the selected file to a location that the event platform can access, then confirm that the uploaded file is the intended image and displays well after cropping.

## 4. Create the event

Use the authorized organizer account and verify the account before editing. Prefer a real draft or preview when the platform supports one, but recognize that some platforms create a live event when the control says "Save" or similar.

Complete fields in this order when practical:

1. **Title:** apply the approved naming pattern, such as `Event Name #N`.
2. **Date and time:** set the local date and complete time range.
3. **Location:** choose the exact venue or map result, not a similarly named listing.
4. **Description:** apply the current template and occurrence-specific updates.
5. **Image:** upload and inspect the image.
6. **Hosts:** add only people authorized to host or co-host.
7. **Settings:** confirm visibility, capacity, cost, RSVP rules, accessibility information, and notifications.

Date pickers and dynamic forms deserve extra care. Finish and verify the date/time selection before editing other fields. After opening a menu, resizing a window, scrolling substantially, or causing the page layout to change, re-check the visible state before clicking. Prefer controls identified by their labels or roles rather than fixed screen positions.

## 5. Verify before and after publishing

Review the draft or preview as an attendee would. Confirm:

- title and occurrence number;
- weekday, date, start time, end time, and time zone;
- exact venue and map pin;
- description, links, and contact information;
- image presence, crop, and legibility;
- host/co-host status; and
- visibility, capacity, cost, and RSVP settings.

If a required item cannot be verified, do not claim the event is ready. Correct it, use a safe fallback, or request a decision under the selected authority mode.

Publish only when authorized. Then open the live page and repeat the attendee-facing checks. Save the live URL.

## 6. Invite the approved audience

Follow the documented invitation policy. A common policy is to invite prior attendees of the same series, but this is not a default. Respect opt-outs, privacy expectations, consent boundaries, and platform restrictions. Do not expand the audience without authorization.

When inviting from prior events, list all relevant occurrences and process them systematically. Filter or review one occurrence at a time, add its attendees, clear the filter, and continue. Check whether people are already selected before using a bulk-select control, since platforms may preselect recent attendees.

After each batch, verify that the invitee count increased by a plausible amount. If it drops or stays unchanged unexpectedly, stop and inspect the current selection before proceeding. Use platform deduplication where available; otherwise compare lists before sending.

Send invitations only when authorized. Confirm the platform's sent state, delivery status, or final invited count. If the platform cannot provide confirmation, state that limitation clearly.

## 7. Report completion

Provide a brief operational report with:

- what was created and whether it was published;
- date, time, and venue;
- invitation outcome or current invitee count;
- conflicts, unresolved items, or nonstandard settings; and
- the live event URL.

When the URL must be easy to copy, put it on the final line with no text after it.

## 8. Maintain the workflow

After each occurrence, record only reusable lessons: changed platform behavior, durable audience rules, template changes, field-order constraints, and content preferences. Keep temporary facts for one event separate from the recurring process.

## Readiness check

Before declaring success, confirm:

- The date and sequence number were calculated and checked.
- The correct organizer account and public event page were verified.
- Stable details are current and occurrence-specific details were updated.
- The artwork is fresh, usable, and correctly uploaded, if artwork is required.
- The end time, time zone, venue, and settings were confirmed.
- Invitations followed the approved policy and respected opt-outs.
- Publishing and invitation results were verified or any verification limit was reported.
