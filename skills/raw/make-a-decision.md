# Make a decision

Use this workflow to apply enough rigor for the decision at hand: make small choices quickly, examine consequential choices properly, record them only with permission, and review outcomes without rewriting history.

## Core rules

1. **Match rigor to stakes and reversibility.** Most decisions deserve minutes, not days.
2. **The user owns their position.** Never state, record, or imply that the user prefers, believes, or decided something they did not actually say.
3. **Separate advice from attribution.** Keep the assistant’s recommendation distinct from the user’s stated view. Include assistant analysis in a record only on request and label it clearly.
4. **Record only with permission.** “Should we do X?” asks for analysis, not for a record. Create or update a decision record only when the user asks to log, track, open, resume, or commit it, or explicitly agrees.
5. **Protect access boundaries.** Before searching a register or reading shared communications, personnel records, customer information, or other sensitive sources, confirm a legitimate purpose and authorization. Use the minimum relevant information.
6. **Do not mistake execution for a decision.** If there is no meaningful alternative, say so and move to planning or doing the work.
7. **Do not deliberate indefinitely.** Once appropriate evidence, challenge, and consultation are complete, make the call and proceed.

Before writing to a shared decision register, confirm that its audience is appropriate. For sensitive matters, such as health, relationships, compensation, or confidential personnel issues, keep the discussion in chat or offer a private record.

## 1. Select the mode

Use the user’s explicit instruction when they give one. Otherwise, if access is authorized, search the chosen decision register for a substantially overlapping decision before creating a duplicate.

- **New:** No matching record exists, or the user asks to start fresh.
- **Resume:** A matching record is open and the user wants to continue considering it.
- **Commit:** An open record exists and the user says they are ready to decide.
- **Review:** A resolved record has reached its review date and has no completed outcome assessment, or is still marked “too early.”

A record’s resolution status means whether the decision was made, not whether the eventual outcome was good. For a non-binary question, mark it resolved once a direction or approach has been selected.

For **Resume**, retrieve the record and append new information; do not overwrite prior reasoning. For **Review**, use the original prediction, confidence, and stated assumptions as the baseline.

## 2. Frame the decision

Put the question in a decidable form. Establish:

- What choice is being made?
- Who has final decision authority?
- What realistic options exist, including doing nothing?
- What deadline, event, or trigger requires a decision?
- What result is sought?
- What happens if no action is taken?

If the issue is broad and credible options do not yet exist, generate options first. Do not pressure-test a vague problem statement.

If only one viable path exists, say:

> This appears to be a task rather than a decision. The next step is to plan or execute it.

Ask one clarifying question at a time when scope is unclear.

## 3. Classify scope

| Bucket | Meaning | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial | Low stakes; reversible within hours | Decide now; do not record by default. |
| Reversible | Moderate stakes; changeable within days or weeks | Compare a few options; use a light record if useful. |
| Hard to reverse | Significant cost, disruption, or loss if undone | Full analysis, challenge gate, and stakeholder check. |
| Direction-setting | Shapes strategy, culture, finances, or operations for an extended period | Full analysis, explicit dissent, and prerequisite conversations. |

When classification is unclear, ask: **What would it cost to unwind this?** Consider money, time, trust, operational disruption, opportunity cost, and reputation. If the unwind cost cannot be named quickly or is highly uncertain, treat the decision as larger.

If the user calls a decision trivial but cannot explain how it can be undone quickly, reclassify it rather than accepting the label.

## 4. Apply the appropriate rigor

### Trivial

Choose a reasonable default, state a one-sentence rationale, and move on. Do not create a record by default. If the user is stalling, name the cost of delay: attention spent may exceed the cost of an imperfect choice.

### Reversible

In a short working session:

1. List two or three realistic options.
2. For each, state one main strength, one main weakness, and a rough effort or cost.
3. Give a recommendation and the decisive reason.
4. If uncertainty is material, identify the smallest reversible test that could change the call.

| Option | Main strength | Main weakness | Effort or cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Option A] | [What it enables] | [Central tradeoff] | [Rough estimate] |

### Hard to reverse: challenge gate

Before commitment, pressure-test the leading option. A valid pressure test covers assumptions, disconfirming evidence, likely failure modes, the strongest alternative, and major stakeholder objections.

If no relevant pressure test has happened in the current decision context, stop the commitment flow and state:

> This is hard to reverse. Pressure-test the leading option before committing. To proceed without that step, explicitly state why the gate is being skipped.

Proceed only after the test is complete or the user explicitly overrides the gate with a reason. Urgency alone is not an override.

If the pressure test finds a serious unresolved failure, do not force commitment. Return to option generation, redesign the option, gather a decision-changing fact, or run a bounded test.

After the gate is satisfied:

1. Define options and criteria.
2. Run a pre-mortem: “It is later and this failed. What most likely caused it?”
3. Check with people who have relevant expertise, bear consequences, or may reveal constraints.
4. Provide a recommendation labeled as assistant analysis unless the user adopts it in their own words.

### Direction-setting

Use the hard-to-reverse process plus two readiness gates:

1. Name the specific accountable leader, partner, advisor, or stakeholder conversation required before commitment.
2. Ask who disagrees, and capture their strongest case fairly.

The decision is not ready until the prerequisite conversation has occurred, unless the user explicitly accepts and records a reason for proceeding without it. If it is rushed, identify what evidence, consultation, or dissent is being skipped and why that matters.

For people-related decisions, use role-relevant capabilities, role alignment, diagnostic evidence, and whether any assessment distinguishes relevant performance. Do not rely on irrelevant personal information or unsupported labels.

## 5. Analyze without inventing certainty

For each serious option, capture what it enables; what it costs, delays, or prevents; its strongest supporting evidence and objection; its key assumptions; and the cost of reversal.

Separate non-negotiable requirements from preferences. Use scores only if they clarify tradeoffs rather than conceal judgment.

Keep these categories separate:

- **User’s stated view:** Only what the user actually expressed.
- **Assistant analysis:** The assistant’s recommendation and reasoning.
- **Open question:** Material uncertainty not yet resolved.

If the user has not stated a position, write “No position stated yet” or leave the field blank. Never fabricate a lean, confidence level, rationale, response to dissent, or final choice.

## 6. Commit and record

Before finalizing, confirm the choice, rationale, reversal conditions, next action owner and date, observable prediction, and the user’s confidence in that prediction.

For meaningful decisions, use a testable prediction:

> By [date or trigger], [observable outcome] will happen or not happen.  
> Confidence: [percentage].

Use the user’s approved decision register, document system, or private file. A useful record includes status, domain, stakes, reversibility, decision date, review date, confidence, and outcome.

For an **open** decision, record context, options, and new inputs, but leave commitment sections blank. For a **commitment**, mark it resolved, record the actual decision date, set confidence, and populate the commitment sections. Do not infer missing user-owned fields.

Default review timing is one month for reversible decisions, three months for hard-to-reverse decisions, and six months for direction-setting decisions. Adjust for a more meaningful event or trigger named by the user.

**Review-reminder gate:** After recording a hard-to-reverse or direction-setting commitment, create a review reminder in an authorized calendar, task system, or equivalent reminder mechanism. The reminder should name the decision, occur on the review date, link to the approved record when appropriate, and give advance notice such as one day before. If no authorized reminder system is available, explicitly give the user a reminder-ready item to add themselves. For reversible decisions, the review-date field or record reminder is normally sufficient unless the user asks for more.

```markdown
## Context
Why this decision exists and why it matters now.

## Options considered
- **Option A:** What it is and its central tradeoff.
- **Option B:** What it is and its central tradeoff.
- **Option C:** [Optional additional option.]

## Thinking log
### [Date]
- New inputs, conversations, data, or events
- How the thinking changed
- User’s stated position today: open / leaning / decided

## Dissent
Who pushed back, their strongest argument, and how it was handled.

## My choice and why
The user’s own reasoning, only when the user stated it.

## What would change my mind
Assumptions or evidence that would justify reversing the choice.

## Prediction
By [date], [observable outcome] will happen or not happen.
Confidence: [X%]

## Worries
The most credible downside or failure mode.

---

## Retrospective
To be completed at review.
```

On resume, append a dated thinking-log entry rather than rewriting history. If the user requests that assistant analysis be stored, label it **Assistant analysis, not the user’s position**.

## 7. Review the outcome

At the review point, assess:

1. **What happened?** Use concrete actuals, not impressions.
2. **Was the prediction accurate?** Compare events with the recorded prediction and confidence.
3. **Was the decision process sound?** Judge the information, assumptions, alternatives, and reasoning available at the time.
4. **What is the reusable lesson?** State a principle for future decisions.

Mark the outcome as correct, incorrect, mixed, too early, or not applicable. Do not treat an unfavorable result as proof of a bad process, or a favorable result as proof of a sound one.

## Completion message

When a decision is made, summarize it clearly:

```markdown
Decision: [one-line call]
Scope: [bucket]
Rationale: [two or three honest sentences]
Next action: [owner] will [action] by [date]
Review: [date or trigger]
Record: [location, if one exists]
```

Use direct language. Challenge weak reasoning with evidence, but do not turn rigor into an excuse for endless deliberation. Once the readiness gates are met, name the decision and move forward.
